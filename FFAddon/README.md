First ensure your Add-on Bar is enabled ((alt key to open menu bar) View->Toolbars->Add-on Bar or just use ctrl+/).

You should see a letter "Q" which you can click to run queries (it will use the current page by default).
Note that when "Q" is black it means that HTTP Query support has not been detected for the currently
loaded webpage. If "Q" is red, support has been detected.
