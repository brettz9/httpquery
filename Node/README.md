# httpquery

## Installation

```shell
npm install
```

Place static files within this "Node" directory and run "index.js" from this
folder.

These dependencies may change at a later date.

The server currently loads nothing by default for the static page if HTTP
Query client support headers are being sent properly, e.g., from the
Firefox add-on (in case the sender wants to take the cue from the server
support response header that he or she can selectively query the desired
portions).

See https://github.com/brettz9/httpquery for more information.
