<div2 xml:id="Introduction" n="2" type="Introduction">
<head><pb n="i"/>Introduction</head>

<p n="1">This volume brings together, for the first time, the communications
addressed to the followers of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in the Australasian area by
Shoghi Effendi during the period of his ministry, from 1921 to 1957,
as Guardian of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith.  Since the majority of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of
Australasia were resident in Australia during that period, most of the letters
collected here were addressed to the believers in that continent.  It constitutes
a valuable depository of the authoritative guidance from the Head of the
Faith during that time.</p>

<p n="2">It is much more than a historical record of letters written to early
followers of this Faith, many of whom are no longer alive.  It provides a
fascinating opportunity to examine the twentieth-century development in
the remote Antipodes of a religion having its origins in the heart of Asia.
The forces and processes which led to the establishment of a staunch <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
community in so distant a region have not, at the present time, been clearly
traced.  It is known that the first mention of the new religion in Australia
was in a Melbourne newspaper in March 1846, less than two years after the
Declaration of the <w type="dw">Bab</w>, to be followed by a report in an Auckland, New
Zealand, newspaper in February 1853.  The first <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in the Antipodes is
accepted as being in New Zealand in 1912, while Australia was opened to
the Faith by its illustrious <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> pioneers in 1920.</p>

<p n="3">One might inquire how a new belief originating in an Asian setting,
promulgated by a small handful of adherents of limited means and modest
social standing, could have been spread far and wide across so vast a region
of the planet as that of Australia and the Pacific Islands, at a time when the
general population displayed no predisposition to embrace a faith other than
orthodox Christianity and no discernible inclination to assess the relative
merits of the great religions of the world.  It is in the pages of this volume
that one might profitably search for an answer to this question.  Sustained
and invigorated by the loving guidance of Shoghi Effendi, the early <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
proceeded slowly, and at times painfully, to propagate their Faith, undeterred
by the meagre response to their efforts or by their own consciousness of
their perceived inadequacy.  Setbacks were overcome, obstacles surmounted,
and discouragement conquered, as these valiant believers struggled ever
onward, confident that one day the Institutions of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administrative
order would be raised up in all parts of the region and would develop as
centres of spiritual illumination and unity.  To read the letters published
here is to attain a profound sense of admiration for the heroism and dogged
<pb n="ii"/>persistence of those first believers and to acquire an abiding gratitude for
their devoted labours.</p>

<p n="4">This book conveys a painfully realistic portrait of the development of
the Australasian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community.  No attempt is made to mask the fact
that the infant community endured periods of deep misunderstanding and
fundamental misconception, of disunity and inertia, of frustration and
impatience in the process of its growth.  But the mysterious power of the
Covenant of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> welded believers from widely-separated areas, from
differing socio-economic backgrounds, and from diverse cultural perspectives,
into the unified, energetic and confident community which now exists and
which is clearly entering a phase of unprecedented growth and consolidation.</p>

<p n="5">The significance of the events referred to in this book might best be
assessed against the background of the evolution of Australian national
consciousness during the years in which the letters were written, since so
much of the correspondence was directed principally to Australia.  In a newly-federated
nation, searching for its identity, acutely conscious of its isolation
from its European cultural roots and of its proximity to Asia, the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
established centres of world-mindedness, of universality and of international
cooperation, symbolized by such actions as the monetary contributions made
by the fledgling community to global <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> endeavours of earthquake relief
in Asia and of construction of the Mother-Temple of the American
continent.</p>

<p n="6">The members of the Australian and New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities
are shown, on the evidence of the letters addressed to them by Shoghi Effendi,
to have represented, in many ways, the best of the character and temperament
of those nations.  Over the years, he called attention to "the loyalty, the
vigour and the devotion" with which they conducted their affairs, expressed
his "admiration for their zeal and noble determination", hailed "the solidarity
and self-sacrifice, the courage and confidence they display in their incessant
and manifold activities", and lauded "the vitality and adventurous spirit the
members of these communities have so strikingly manifested".  In a society
which was male-oriented to an extreme, <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> women played a courageous
and disproportionate role as pioneers, teachers and administrators of the
Faith.  Disregarding the prevailing tendencies to assign little value to the
indigenous peoples, the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> attached importance to attracting to their
Cause as brothers and sisters the Aboriginal Australians and the Maori New
Zealanders, thus contributing to the upliftment of the peoples and to their
enlistment in the world-wide endeavour of spiritual regeneration of
humanity.</p>

<p n="7">This book is of far more than archival value.  It provides insight into
<pb n="iii"/>the complex dynamics of the growth of a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community in a Western
society, and into the gradual emergence of that community from unmitigated
obscurity into a position of admiration and respect from the most progressive
elements of that society.  It might also profitably be studied for the
clarifications it offers about various aspects of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings, and the
prescription it sets out for the process of acquiring a more profound
comprehension of these teachings.  As world events unfold, a deeper
understanding will be gained of the significance of the "spiritual axis,
extending from the Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific Ocean"
to which the Guardian referred.</p>

<p n="8">The prodigious accomplishments of Shoghi Effendi in the 36 years of
his ministry as Guardian of the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> are a continuing source
of wonder and astonishment.  A perusal of his letters to Australasia reveals
his infinite patience, his compelling logic, the clarity of his thought, his
sensitivity to believers who only dimly grasped the importance of the work
to which he was calling them, his compassion for them in their setbacks,
and the fathomless love and tenderness with which he nurtured and trained
them from spiritual infancy to adulthood.  As stated by the Universal House
of Justice in its tribute to Shoghi Effendi on the occasion of the first World
Congress in 1963:</p>

<p n="9">He it was, and he alone, who unfolded the potentialities of
the widely scattered, numerically small, and largely unorganized
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community which had been called into being during the
Heroic Age of the Faith.  He it was who unfolded the grand design
of God's Holy Cause; set in motion the great plans of teaching
already outlined by <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>; established the institutions and
greatly extended the endowments at the World Centre, and raised
the Temples of America, Africa, Australasia, and Europe;
developed the Administrative Order of the Cause throughout the
world; and set the ark of the Cause true on its course.</p>

<p n="10">The passage of years will magnify rather than diminish the gratitude
that succeeding generations of Australasian <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> will feel for his
monumental labours.</p>

<head><pb n="iv"/>Preface</head>

<p n="1">The <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities of Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific
Islands had their origins at the very dawn of the Formative Age.
Their early champions were nurtured by heroes and heroines whose
belief in the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> had been confirmed and consolidated
through contact with <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, during his travels to the West.  Through
the unaided efforts of Clara and Hyde Dunn, the Master's wish that his
Father's teachings be spread to the islands of the South Seas was thus realised
within his lifetime.  Soon after, news of his passing spread a cold wind over
the pioneers, which only the tender and hopeful words of Shoghi Effendi
could clear.  At the time of his appointment as Guardian and Head of the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith, in the <bibl><title>Will and Testament of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w></title></bibl>, there were <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
in no more than thirty-five countries of the world.  Thirty-six years later,
when at the untimely close of his ministry, the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> had
become known in nearly two hundred more, modest geographical and
numerical spread had enlarged the scope of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community in
Australasia from two members in one country, to some thousands of followers
in over 100 localities in Australia and New Zealand, and a further 210
localities amongst the islands of the Pacific.  From the pen of Shoghi Effendi
had flowed to them more than 700 letters and cables.  Although the number
of communications is small when compared to the volume of guidance
directed to individual <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> and to <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> institutions in other continents,
the Australian and New Zealand communities share with them the rare
privilege of having been in contact with Shoghi Effendi from the beginning
to the end of his ministry.  With his unerring guidance, local and national
institutions of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> rising World Order in the "antipodes" were
nurtured through their infancy and period of complete obscurity.  By 1963,
three of the original fifty-six pillars of the Universal House of Justice had
been raised in the South Pacific.</p>

<p n="3">In 1970 the <bibl><publisher>Australian National Spiritual Assembly</publisher></bibl> published <bibl><title>Letters
from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand 1923 -- 1957</title></bibl>; in 1982, to mark
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the formation of the New Zealand National
Spiritual Assembly, that body produced <bibl><title>Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi
to New Zealand</title></bibl>.  The significant expansion of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities in these
two countries, as well as in the islands of the Pacific, in recent years, together
with the lack of accessibility to the aforementioned books and other earlier
publications, made it imperative that the Guardian's correspondence with
individuals and institutions in the Australasian region be made more widely
available.  The suggestion was made in late 1988 to gather this
<pb n="v"/>correspondence in one publication.  The task became one of considerable
regional collaboration.  About one third of the communications from the
Guardian were in the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Archives at Mona Vale in Sydney.
To these were added others received from the National Spiritual Assemblies
of the Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Mariana Islands, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Tonga, and the Western Caroline Islands.  Not all of these Assemblies
had additional information, but all deserve thanks for their investigations.</p>

<p n="4">Numerous individuals also shared precious letters received from Shoghi
Effendi.  Among the pioneers to the Pacific, Lilian Ala'i, Margaret and Noel
Bluett, Virginia Breaks, Vi Hoehnke, Elena Marsella, and Jean Sevin
responded to requests for copies of previously unpublished letters.  The late
James Heggie also shared copies of his treasured correspondence.  Throughout
the project, the late Hand of the Cause of God Mr Collis Featherstone gave
encouragement, and much guidance.  Mrs Madge Featherstone also assisted
greatly, finding several previously unknown letters in Mr Featherstone's
papers.</p>

<p n="5">The work was greatly aided by the patient, invaluable, and meticulous
work of the staff at the Department of Library and Archival Services at the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World Centre, who supplied several hundred communications that
had not been located in searching Australian and Pacific archives.  Other
correspondence was received from the United States National <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Archives.  Following the task of keying the letters and cables onto computer,
an advisory team to review the project, consisting of Miguel Gil, Lilian
Ala'i, and Aflatoon Payman (aided in later stages by <w type="dw"> Manuchir</w> Gabriel and
Rod Haake), painstakingly checked proofs against copies of the original
communications.  Reproduction of photographs in photo section was handled
by Stephen Beale.  Layout, design, and final production were handled by
Barry Anderson.</p>

<p n="6">A word concerning the scope of this book is necessary.  Dr Peter Khan
has pointed out that this publication by no means constitutes a regional
history of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith--although its contents facilitate the writing of
such.  Nor do its pages fully detail the most significant personalities and
episodes in the Australasian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities--for whereas some
individuals chose to write to Shoghi Effendi (as they were expressly
encouraged by him to do), others refrained, not wishing to add to his heavy
workload news of what they regarded as their small concerns, or victories.
Hence the mention or otherwise of people and places in this work, and
whether on one occasion or many, does not measure the contribution of
each.  That task awaits another time.</p>

<p n="7">Shoghi Effendi is known to have written some 26,000 letters to the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world: those directed to the Antipodes, approximately 700, appear
<pb n="vi"/>in the present volume.  These include 81 that appeared in <bibl><title>Letters of the
Guardian to Australia and New Zealand</title></bibl>, as well as 82 published in <bibl><title>Arohanui:
letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand</title></bibl>.  A select number of additional
letters have been included which, although not directed to correspondents
within the region, have some direct relevance to it.</p>

<p n="8">As the letters were penned for Shoghi Effendi by a series of secretaries,
across almost four decades, they lack a uniformity in style and presentation.
Different uses of "s" and "z", for example, have been retained, rather than
standardised.  Every effort has been taken to ensure that the contents of the
letters have been reproduced in their entirety.  In a few instances, however,
names have been omitted out of respect for the privacy of individuals.  Minor
errors in grammar and style have been corrected with permission of the
Department of Archives.  The name and address of the addressee, where
they were included in a letter, have been reproduced.  In other cases, details
have been supplied from accompanying envelopes, or other sources, and
supplied in brackets thus [].  Text written by Shoghi Effendi's own hand has
been rendered in italics.</p>

<p n="9">Shoghi Effendi had difficulty in securing suitable secretarial support.
At some times family members assisted, while at others, Western <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
served as secretaries during extended periods spent in Haifa.  They included
<w type="dw">Azizu'llah</w> S. <w type="dw">Bahadur</w> (in 1924), Soheil <w type="dw">Afnan</w> (1924 -- 30), Ruhi <w type="dw">Afnan</w>
(1926 -- 1933), H. <w type="dw">Rabbani</w> (1931 -- 40), Mehrenguiz <w type="dw">Rabbani</w> (1932), J.E.
Esslemont--who had lived in Australia briefly before becoming a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>--
(1925), and Ethel J. Rosenberg (1927).  Later, secretarial support was given
the Guardian by <w type="dw">Ruhiyyih</w> <w type="dw"> Khanum</w>, and in the 1950s, Amelia Collins
(1951), Leroy Ioas (1952 -- 57), and Jessie Revell (1953).</p>

<p n="10">It is hoped that the publication of the Guardian's communications to
the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of the Australasian region at this time will assist us in
understanding the social and spiritual context in which we labour, and in
grasping also the potential for the unfoldment of these communities, as
Shoghi Effendi so clearly and expectantly described.</p>

and proclaimed and has attracted such a promising number of ardent and faithful

<p n="2">I offer you my heartfelt love and sympathy and the assurance of my unfailing
assistance in the great work of service to mankind which is now so gloriously

<p n="3">I have shared fully your news with those loving pilgrims and resident friends in
the Holy Land whom I meet regularly in what was in the past the audience-chamber
of the Master and who thirst after the tidings of the progress of the Cause in every

that the seeds of faith and loving fellowship that you are casting in the soil of hearts
may germinate and swell the ever increasing number of the valiant hosts of <w type="dw">Baha</w>
and enable them to attain glorious victory.</p>

<p n="4">I shall await with eager expectation the welcome news of the extension of your

throughout the world, the plans you contemplate for the spreading of the Movement
and the means you will utilise for their speedy execution.  On my part I shall never
neglect to send you such news as will urge you to press forward your great work
for the Cause and hearten you in your labours of love and devotion at His Sacred

America, Great Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Japan and

<lb/>
Fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Over a year has elapsed since that calamitous Hour, when the glorious Person
of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> was veiled from mortal eyes and His Spirit ascended the Kingdom
of Glory; and I feel that the time is now ripe to take those fresh and momentous
decisions which will enable us to fulfil, speedily and faithfully, the last wishes of
our departed Master.</p>

<p n="2">The year has been to the outside world a year of fear and suffering, of disillusion
and turmoil.  To us, however, the bereaved followers of a gracious and loving
Master, it has been, despite the passing cares which His sudden departure must
necessarily entail, a period of hope, of wholesome activity, marked throughout
with a spirit of undiminished confidence in His power and of fidelity to His Cause.</p>

<p n="3">From the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, the
unnumbered servants of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, disdainful of the evil machinations of the
enemies of His Cause, the breakers of His behests, have rallied to His Standard,
and risen with one accord to carry on the great Work He has entrusted to their
charge.  All-hail to that undying Spirit of Fidelity which burns, and shall burn
unceasingly, in the breasts of His loved ones!  Great shall be their reward, and
blissful the hour, when after a toilsome life of service, they are gathered to the glory
of <w type="dw">Baha</w>, and partake in their Beloved's Presence, of the joy of eternal Reunion.</p>

<p n="4">But great achievements still await us in this world, and we feel confident that,
by His grace and never-failing guidance, we shall now and ever prove ourselves
worthy to fulfil His great Purpose for mankind.  And who can fail to realise the
sore need of bleeding humanity, in its present state of uncertainty and peril, for the
regenerating Spirit of God, manifested this Day so powerfully in this Divine
Dispensation?  Four years of unprecedented warfare and world cataclysms, followed
by another four years of bitter disappointment and suffering, have stirred deeply
the conscience of mankind, and opened the eyes of an unbelieving world to the
Power of the Spirit that alone can cure its sicknesses, heal its wounds, and establish
the long-promised reign of undisturbed prosperity and peace.</p>

<p n="5">Now surely, if ever, is the time for us, the chosen ones of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and the
bearers of His Message to the world, to endeavour, by day and by night, to deepen,
first and foremost, the Spirit of His Cause in our own individuals lives, and then
labour, and labour incessantly to exemplify in all our dealings with our fellow-men
that noble Spirit of which His beloved Son, <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, has been all the days of
His life a true and unique exponent.  The sayings of our beloved Master have been
noised abroad, His name has filled all regions, and the eyes of mankind are now
<pb n="4"/>turned expectant towards His disciples who bear His name and profess His
teachings.  Shall we not by our daily life vindicate the high claims of His teachings,
and prove by our services the influence of His undying Spirit?  This surely is our
highest privilege, and our most sacred duty.</p>

<p n="6">Let us, with a pure heart, with humility and earnestness, turn afresh to His
counsels and exhortations, and seek from that Source of Celestial Potency all the
guidance, the Spirit, the power which we shall need for the fulfilment of our mission
in this life.</p>

<p n="7">Behold, the Station to which <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> is now calling His loved ones from
the Realm of Glory:--</p>

<p n="8">It behoveth the loved ones of God to be enamoured of one another
and to sacrifice themselves for their fellow-workers in the Cause.
They should yearn towards one another even as the sore athirst
yearneth for the Water of Life, and the lover burneth to meet his
heart's desire."</p>

<p n="9">Such is the sublime, the glorious position He wishes us, and all the peoples and
kindreds on earth to attain in this world; how much more to achieve unity and
common understanding among ourselves, and then arise to herald with one voice
the coming of the Kingdom and the salvation of mankind.</p>

<p n="10">With unity of purpose firmly established in our minds, with every trace of
personal animosity banished from our hearts, and with the spirit of whole-hearted
and sustained fellowship kindled in our souls, can we hope to deliver effectively the
Message of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and execute faithfully the various provisions of our
Beloved's <bibl><title>Will and Testament</title></bibl>.</p>

<p n="11">Steadfast in our faith, firm in our union, abounding in our love, fervent in
our spirit, and selfless in our labours, let us arise and with prayerful hearts make
another and supreme effort to fulfil these last words of our Beloved, His most
cherished desire:--</p>

<p n="12">"O ye that stand fast in the Covenant!  When the hour cometh that
this wronged and broken winged bird will have taken its flight unto
the Celestial Concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of
the Unseen, and its mortal frame will have either been lost or hidden
neath the dust, it is incumbent upon the <w type="dw">Afnan</w> that are steadfast in
the Covenant of God and have branched from the Tree of Holiness,
the Hands of the Cause of God, (the Glory of the Lord rest upon
them), and all the friends and loved ones, one and all, to bestir
themselves and arise with heart and soul and in one accord to diffuse
the sweet savours of God, to teach His Cause and to promote His
Faith.  It behoveth them not to rest for a moment, neither to seek
repose.  They must disperse themselves in every land, pass by every
clime, and travel throughout all regions.  Bestirred, without rest, and
<pb n="5"/>steadfast to the end, they must raise in every land the triumphal cry
of <w type="dw">Ya</w> <w type="dw">Baha'il-Abha</w>!, must achieve renown in the world wherever
they go, must burn brightly even as a candle in every meeting, and
must kindle the flame of Divine Love in every Assembly; that the
Light of Truth may rise resplendent in the midmost heart of the world,
that throughout the East and throughout the West a vast concourse
may gather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the sweet
savours of Holiness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly,
hearts be filled with the Divine Spirit and souls be made heavenly.  In
these days the most important of all things is the guidance of the
nations and peoples of the world.  Teaching the Cause is of utmost
importance, for it is the head corner-stone of the foundation itself.
This wronged servant has spent his days and nights in promoting the
Cause, and urging the peoples to service.  He rested not a moment,
till the fame of the Cause of God was noised abroad in the world,
and the celestial Strains from the <w type="dw">Abha</w> Kingdom roused the East
and the West.  The beloved of God I must also follow the same
example.  This is the secret of faithfulness, this is the requirement of
servitude to the Threshold of <w type="dw">Baha</w>."</p>


<p n="13">We need but glance at the Words of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and the Epistles of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>
to realise the great privilege of teaching the Cause, its vital necessity, its
supreme urgency, and its wide-reaching effects.  These are the very words of <w type="dw"> Abdu'l-Baha</w>:--</p>

<p n="14">"In these days, the Holy Ones of the Realm of Glory, dwelling in the
all-highest Paradise, yearn to return unto this world, and be of some
service to the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and prove their servitude to the
Threshold of the <w type="dw">Abha</w> Beauty."</p>

<p n="15">What a wondrous vision these words unfold to our eyes!  How great our privilege
to labour in this Day in the Divine Vineyard!  Is it not incumbent upon us to arise
and teach His Cause with such an ardour which no worldly adversity can quell,
nor any measure of success can satiate?</p>

<p n="16">And, now, that this all-important Work may suffer no neglect, but rather
function vigorously and continuously in every part of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World; that the
unity of the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> may remain secure and inviolate, it is of the
utmost importance that in accordance with the explicit text of the <bibl><title><w type="dw">Kitabu'l-Aqdas</w>,
the Most Holy Book</title></bibl>, in every locality, be it city or hamlet, where the number of
adult (21 years and above) declared believers exceeds nine, a local "Spiritual
Assembly" be forthwith established.  To it all local matters pertaining to the Cause
must be directly and immediately referred for full consultation and decision.  The
importance, nay the absolute necessity of these Local Assemblies is manifest when
we realise that in the days to come they will evolve into the local Houses of Justice,
<pb n="6"/>and at present provide the firm foundation on which the Structure of the Master's
Will is to be reared in future.</p>

<p n="17">The matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its extension, its
consolidation, essential as they are to the interests of the Cause, constitute by no
means the only issue which should receive the full attention of these Assemblies.  A
careful study of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> Tablets will reveal that other
duties, no less vital to the interests of the Cause, devolve upon the elected
representatives of the friends in every locality.</p>

<p n="18">It is incumbent upon them to be vigilant and cautious, discreet and watchful,
and protect at all times the Temple of the Cause from the dart of the mischief-maker
and the onslaught of the enemy.</p>

<p n="19">They must endeavour to promote amity and concord amongst the friends,
efface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement from every heart,
and secure in its stead an active and whole-hearted co-operation for the service of
the Cause.</p>

<p n="20">They must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the poor,
the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of colour, cast and
creed.</p>

<p n="21">They must promote by every means in their power the material as well as the
spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education of children, institute,
whenever possible <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> educational institutions, organise and supervise their
work and provide the best means for their progress and development.</p>

<p n="22">They must make an effort to maintain official, regular, and frequent
correspondence with the various <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> centres throughout the world, report to
them their activities, and share the glad-tidings they receive with all their fellow-workers
in the Cause.</p>

<p n="23">They must bend every effort to promote the interests of the <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w>,
and hasten the day when the work of this glorious Edifice will have been
consummated.</p>

<p n="24">They must encourage and stimulate by every means at their command, through
subscription, reports and articles, the development of the various <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Magazines,
such as the <bibl><title level="j">Star of the West</title> and the <title level="j">Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom</title>
<pubPlace>in the United States of America</pubPlace>, the <title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> News</title> <pubPlace>of India</pubPlace>, the <title level="j">Sun of the
East (<w type="dw">Khurshid-i-Khavar</w>)</title> <pubPlace>in Turkestan</pubPlace>, the <title>Star of the East</title> <pubPlace>in Japan</pubPlace>, the
<title level="j">Sun of Truth</title> <pubPlace>in Germany</pubPlace></bibl>.</p>

<p n="25">They must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the friends,
the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special gatherings designed to serve
and promote the social, intellectual and spiritual interests of their fellow-men.</p>

<p n="26">They must supervise in these days when the Cause is still in its infancy all
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> publications and translations, and provide in general for a dignified and
accurate presentation of all <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature and its distribution to the general
public.</p>

<p n="27"><pb n="7"/>These rank among the most outstanding obligations of the members of every
Spiritual Assembly.  In whatever locality the Cause has sufficiently expanded, and
in order to ensure efficiency and avoid confusion, each of these manifold functions
will have to be referred to a special Committee, responsible to that Assembly,
elected by it from among the friends in that locality, and upon whose work the
Assembly will have to exercise constant and general supervision.</p>

<p n="28">These Local Spiritual Assemblies will have to be elected directly by the friends,
and every declared believer of 21 years and above, far from standing aloof and
assuming an indifferent or independent attitude, should regard it his sacred duty to
take part, conscientiously and diligently, in the election, the consolidation, and the
efficient working of his own Local Assembly.</p>

<p n="29">Regarding the establishment of "National Assemblies", it is of vital importance
that in every country, where the conditions are favourable and the number of the
friends has grown and reached a considerable size, such as America, Great Britain
and Germany, that a "National Spiritual Assembly" be immediately established, representative of the friends throughout that country.</p>

<p n="30">Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and co-ordinate, by frequent
personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends as well as the Local
Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant touch with the Holy Land,
initiate measures, and direct in general the affairs of the Cause in that country.</p>

<p n="31">It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as in the course
of time it shall evolve into the National House of Justice, (referred to in <bibl><author><w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w></author>
<title>Will</title></bibl> as the "secondary House of Justice") which according to the explicit
text of the Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National Assemblies
throughout the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world to elect directly the members of the International
House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will guide, organize and unify the
affairs of the Movement throughout the world.</p>

<p n="32">It is expressly recorded in <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> Writings that these National
Assemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that is, the friends in every
country must elect a certain number of delegates, who in their turn will elect from
among all the friends in that country the members of the National Spiritual
Assembly.  In such countries, therefore, as America, Great Britain and Germany,
a fixed number of secondary electors must first be decided upon, (95 for America,
including the Pacific Islands; 95 for Germany; and 19 for Great Britain).  The
friends then in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds
nine, must directly elect its quota of secondary electors, assigned to it in direct
proportion to its numerical strength.  These secondary electors, will then, either
through correspondence, or preferably by gathering together, and first deliberating
upon the affairs of the Cause throughout their country, (as the delegates to the
Convention) then elect from among all the friends in that country nine who will be
the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.</p>

<p n="33"><pb n="8"/>This National Spiritual Assembly, which pending the establishment of the
Universal House of Justice will have to be re-elected once a year, obviously assumes
grave responsibilities, for it has to exercise full authority over all the Local Assemblies
in its province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly
the Cause of God, and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in
general.</p>

<p n="34">Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country, such as the
matter of translation and publication, the <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w>, the Teaching Work,
and other similar matters that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be
under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly.</p>

<p n="35">It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the Local Assemblies, to
a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the National Spiritual
Assemblies from among all the friends in that country, which will bear to it the
same relation as the local committees bear to their respective Local Assemblies.</p>

<p n="36">With it too rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is strictly local in
its nature, and should be reserved for the consideration and decision of the Local
Assembly, or whether it should fall under its own province and be regarded as a
matter which ought to receive its special attention.  The National Spiritual Assembly
will also decide upon such matters which in its opinion should be referred to the
Holy Land for consultation and decision.</p>

<p n="37">With these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously, vigorously,
and efficiently functioning throughout the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world, the only means for the
establishment of the Supreme House of Justice will have been secured.  And when
this Supreme Body will have been properly established, it will have to consider
afresh the whole situation, and lay down the principle which shall direct, so long as
it deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause.</p>

<p n="38">Pending its establishment, and to ensure uniformity throughout the East and
throughout the West, all Local Assemblies will have to be re-elected once a year,
during the first day of <w type="dw">Ridvan</w>, and the result of polling, if possible, be declared on
that day.</p>

<p n="39">In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may not fall a prey to
conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its purity and pristine vigour, that its
affairs may be conducted with efficiency and promptness, it is necessary that
everyone should conscientiously take an active part in the election of these
Assemblies, abide by their decision, enforce their decree, and co-operate with them
whole-heartedly in their task of stimulating the growth of the Movement throughout
all regions.  The members of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard utterly
their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and inclinations, and concentrate
their minds upon those measures that will conduce to the welfare and happiness of
the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community and promote the common weal.</p>

<p n="40">And as the progress and extension of spiritual activities is dependent and
<pb n="9"/>conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute necessity that immediately after
the establishment of Local as well as National Spiritual Assemblies, a <emph rend="underscore"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Fund</emph>
be established, to be placed under the exclusive control of the Spiritual Assembly.
All donations and contributions should be offered to the Treasurer of the Assembly,
for the express purpose of promoting the interests of the Cause, throughout that
locality or country.  It is the sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful
servant of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely
and generously for the increase of that Fund.  The members of the Spiritual Assembly
will at their own discretion expend it to promote the Teaching Campaign, to help
the needy, to establish educational <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> institutions, to extend in every way
possible their sphere of service.  I cherish the hope that all the friends, realizing the
necessity of this measure, will bestir themselves and contribute, however modestly
at first, towards the speedy establishment and the increase of that Fund.</p>

<p n="41">The need for the centralization of authority in the National Spiritual Assembly,
and the concentration of power in the various Local Assemblies, is made manifest
when we reflect that the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> is still in its age of tender growth
and in a stage of transition; when we remember that the full implications and the
exact significance of the Master's world-wide Instructions, as laid down in His
Will are as yet not fully grasped, and the whole Movement has not sufficiently
crystallized in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p n="42">It is our primary task to keep the most vigilant eye on the manner and character
of its growth, to combat effectively the forces of separatism and of sectarian
tendencies, lest the Spirit of the Cause be obscured, its unity be threatened, its
teachings suffer corruption, lest extreme orthodoxy on one hand, and irresponsible
freedom on the other, cause it to deviate from that Straight Path which alone can
lead it to success.</p>

<p n="43">But let us be on our guard--so the Master continually reminds us from His
Station on high--lest too much concern in that which is secondary in importance,
and too long a preoccupation with the details of our affairs and activities, make us
neglectful of the most essential, the most urgent of all our obligations, namely to
bury our cares and teach the Cause, delivering far and wide this Message of
Salvation to a sorely-stricken world.</p>

<p n="44">To His valiant combatants on earth, who at times may feel disheartened, our
ever-victorious Commander, <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, gives the following assurance:--</p>

<p n="45"><!-- begin quote -->"O ye servants of the Sacred Threshold!  The triumphant Hosts of
the Celestial Concourse, arrayed and marshalled in the Realms above,
stand ready and expectant to assist and assure victory to that valiant
horseman who with confidence spurs on his charger into the arena of
service.  Well is it with that fearless warrior, who armed with the
power of true Knowledge, hastens into the field, disperses the armies
of ignorance, and scatters the hosts of error, who holds aloft the
<pb n="10"/>Standard of Divine Guidance, and sounds the Clarion of Victory.
By the righteousness of the Lord!  He hath achieved a glorious triumph
and obtained the true victory..."</p>
<!-- end quote -->

<p n="46">With such inspiring words as these, are we to remain any longer unmoved and
inactive?  His trumpet-call resounds on every side, and summons us to service; are
we to tarry and hesitate?  His Voice is calling aloud from every land; let us march
on, undeterred and unafraid, and fulfil our glorious Destiny.</p>

[From the Guardian:]

<salute>The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful, throughout
Australasia.
<lb/>
Dearly beloved brethren and sisters in <w type="dw"> Abdu'l-Baha</w>!</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">I have been deeply touched by the welcome letter which our beloved friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Dunn, have sent me from that far-away land, and I am delighted to
hear of the deep and widespread interest that they have awakened in the hearts of
its people in the truths of this glorious Revelation.  Their marvellous energy, their
unwavering determination, their devoted labours to spread the Teachings of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> far and wide have excited the admiration of all the resident friends in
the Holy Land and have revived my hopes for the glorious future of that distant
continent.  I have incorporated the contents of that encouraging letter in the circular
letter which is sent once every nineteen days by the Spiritual Assembly of Haifa to
all the various Spiritual Assemblies throughout the East and I am confident that
your news will be received by all of them with intense delight and gratitude.</p>

<p n="2">May that small and rising community in Australia raise the Call of the New
Day of God in the heart of that promising continent, and set aflame the hearts of
its people with the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Spirit that alone can give the world the Peace that it
craves for and which no human power can ever hope to achieve.</p>

<p n="3">I have also read with deep satisfaction the enclosed letters sent by my beloved
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> brother &amp; sister Mr. B. Dewing<note n="3" type="foot">Edward Bertram Maurice Dewing (1902 -- 1972) became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> after meeting
the Dunns in Auckland in 1923.  He had been involved in "Rationalism" and
New Thought.  In 1925 he founded the magazine of <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl>.  In 1958 he
was elected to the New Zealand National Assembly, and in the same year
pioneered to Northland.  He passed away in New Plymouth in 1972.</note> &amp; Miss. Nora Lee.<note n="4" type="foot">Miss Nora Lee became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> having met the Dunns in New Zealand.  She
was private secretary to Lady Salisbury in South Africa before arriving in New
Zealand in 1921.  In 1924 she moved to Labasa, Fiji, to work as a nanny, and
although she subsequently maintained contact with the Australian and New
Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> little else is known about her.</note></p>

<p n="4">I very earnestly urge them to concentrate for the present their attention on the
spread of the Movement in Australia, and do all they can to establish various
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> centres in those remote regions of the globe.  I sincerely and fervently pray
on their behalf that they may be divinely guided and richly blessed in their efforts to
consolidate the Work that has been so admirably and beautifully started in that
land.  Extreme pressure of work, unfortunately, prevents me from corresponding
with the friends individually, but I wish to assure them one and all that in my
hours of prayer and silent meditation, I remember them most tenderly and beseech
on their behalf whenever I visit the Sacred Shrines, the protection and the grace of
<pb n="15"/>God, that they may herald the Glad-Tidings of the Kingdom to this distracted and
disillusioned world.</p>

<p n="5">Regarding the questions raised in our beloved <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> brother, Mr. Dewing's
letter, I feel that I can not add to what has already been fully and clearly stated by
our Master <bibl><author><w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w></author></bibl> in the book of <bibl><title>Some Answered Questions</title></bibl>, where, I
am sure, she will find the clue to all the perplexing questions that agitate the mind
of man in his search after true knowledge.  The more this Book is read with care
and patience, the greater are its revelations, and the more complete the
understanding of its inner truth and significance.</p>

<p n="6">I am enclosing for your perusal various selections and prayers from the writings
of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, which I am sure will stimulate you to further
action and greater perseverance in your labours for His Cause.</p>

<p n="7">I eagerly await your individual as well as collective letters, and am so anxious
to know more of the progress of your activities, and the plans that you contemplate
for the effective propagation of the Movement in that part of the world.</p>

<closer>
<salute>Assuring you again of my constant prayers for your guidance, protection and
success in the field of service,
<lb/>
I am your devoted brother and co-worker,</salute>

<salute>The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful in New South
Wales, New Zealand and Victoria.  Care of Mr. and Mrs. Hyde Dunn,
Victoria.
<lb/>
Dearly beloved brethren and sisters in the Love of God!</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The two letters which I have recently received from our active and devoted
brother, Mr. Hyde Dunn, dated April 1st and 5th, have given me the greatest
pleasure, as they indicated the growth of a deepfelt interest in the Movement,
throughout those outlying regions of the earth.</p>

<p n="2">How great is your privilege to labour in this Day in the Divine Vineyard!
How sweet and encouraging the thought that the seeds you now scatter will soon
germinate and yield an abundant harvest!  It is my prayer and hope that your
energy may never slacken, your faith and courage never fade, that you may
advance, steadily and peacefully, and attain your heart's desire.</p>

<p n="3">It is of the utmost importance that those friends whose souls have been illumined
by the Light of this Divine Revelation, should if possible scatter over that vast
continent, establish themselves in various localities, and from there as their
permanent headquarters, travel in the vicinity and endeavour to win to this Cause
the most able, the most enlightened of all men.</p>

<p n="4">I shall be most happy to learn of the address of these various permanent
residences, that I may immediately communicate with them all, and do all that I
can to consolidate their respective centres, and promote the work of Teaching.  I
<pb n="16"/>would welcome also the permanent postal and telegraphic address of Mr. and
Mrs. Hyde Dunn, which will enable me to keep in constant touch with the progress
of the Work in that part of the world.</p>

<p n="5">It is my ardent prayer that Mrs. Culbert<note n="5" type="foot">Mrs. Culbert joined the Melbourne <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community in 1923, but little else is
known about her.</note> will grow in understanding and power and become one of the resplendent lights in this Divine Dispensation.</p>

<p n="6">I very strongly urge you, whenever possible to travel to the Islands of the
South Seas, and there raise the glorious Call of the Kingdom, and attract many a
soul to these heavenly Teachings.  I pray at the Three Holy Shrines that the way
may be made open, that obstacles may be speedily surmounted, that His promises
may be fulfilled.</p>

<p n="7">The Greatest Holy Leaf, whose health I am glad to announce is steadily
improving, joins me in wishing you all the highest success in your noble and steadfast
endeavours.</p>

My dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> sister,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your beautiful letter of April 3rd written to the beloved Guardian of
the Cause of God, our dear Shoghi Effendi was received.  He was much
impressed and charmed with the spirit of your letter which indicated deep
devotion to and absolute dependence on the Holy Spirit of the beloved
Master, <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>.</p>

<p n="2">He instructed me with a heart overflowing with love to answer your
letter, conveying to you his high estimation for the beauty of the faith of
the New Zealand friends and deep appreciation towards the splendid services
of our dear Mr. and Mrs. Dunn who are so wonderfully blessed and assisted
by the power of the Holy Ghost.  He loves you all and prays for your happiness
and spiritual growth.</p>

<p n="3">It is true that your group is now still small, but he assures you that your
<pb n="17"/>group will before long grow larger and larger day by day.  It has been always
the case with the growth of every religion.  Some pure soul or souls go to
some land and sow the seeds of the heavenly teachings in the hearts of few
who are most pure and so most receptive.  The seeds will germinate and
grow in them.  The fruits of those seeds appear in the regeneration of the
lives of those primary adherents.  These primary adherents share the bounties
they have received with other souls who through them obtain new life and
light and in turn illumine other people.</p>

<p n="4">The primary adherents are the stars of great magnitude in every land
in the firmament of the Kingdom of God.  They are the chosen people.
They are like candles which, through their sacrificial efforts, are weeping
their lives away in order to give light to the world and establish the purpose
of their Lord and Saviour, which purpose is the salvation of mankind.  Reflect
upon the time of that great Saviour of mankind, His Holiness Jesus Christ!
See how small the group of His disciples was!  No matter how few the number
of the disciples was, yet they through His power illumined the world.  Our
Era is similar to that, but through the development of humanity it is greater
and through the evils of the material civilization and negligence of mankind
our sacrifices must be greater.  Divine light must make itself manifest in our
daily life deeds.</p>

<p n="5">In the early days of the appearance of our Saviour virtue was to save
<emph rend="underscore">ourselves</emph>.  When we are once established in our faith, then virtue is to save
<emph rend="underscore">others</emph>.  The three mottoes of education hold true in our case too.  First <emph rend="underscore">grow</emph>,
then <emph rend="underscore">become</emph> and then <emph rend="underscore">contribute</emph>.  We have developed; we have established
ourselves; and now it is time to contribute to others.  We have inexhaustible
capital.  The candles of our spiritual lives constantly weep away their lives
in shedding light to the world, but they never become exhausted.  For there
is connection between our lives and that of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and our beloved
<w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>.</p>

<p n="6">It cannot be described how much we long to see our dear New Zealand
brethren and sisters.  We hope the day will come when they can come to us
and we to them.  Meanwhile, we are praying at the Holy Threshold of our
beloved Master for your success and happiness.  We hope you will pray for us
too.  The effect of the prayers of the pure hearts is tremendously great.</p>

<p n="7">Our dear Shoghi Effendi wants you not to look at your own capacity,
but at the power of the Holy Ghost of God.  He sends you all his loving
greeting and tender affection.</p>

<lb/>
<dateline><date>2 December 1923</date></dateline>

<salute>[<w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New Zealand]
<lb/>
Fellow-labourers in the Divine Vineyard!</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Upon my return, after a forced and prolonged absence, to the Holy Land, it
is my first and most ardent wish to renew and strengthen those ties of brotherly
love and fellowship that bind our hearts together in our common servitude to His
Sacred Threshold.</p>

<p n="2">The two years that have elapsed since the passing of our beloved Master have
been for the Cause, as well as for mankind, years of deep anxiety and strain.  The
momentous changes that are taking place in the history of both have proved so
swift and far-reaching as to arouse in certain hearts a strange misgiving as to their
stability and future.</p>

<p n="3">On the one hand the remarkable revelations of the Beloved's <bibl><title>Will and Testament</title></bibl>
so amazing in all its aspects, so emphatic in its injunctions, have challenged and
perplexed the keenest minds, whilst the ever-increasing confusion of the world,
threatened as never before with disruptive forces, fierce rivalries, fresh commotions
and grave disorder, have well-nigh overwhelmed the heart and damped the zeal of
even the most enthusiastic believers in the destiny of mankind.</p>

<p n="4">And yet, how often we seem to forget the clear and repeated warnings of our
beloved Master, who in particular during the concluding years of his mission on
earth, laid stress on the severe mental tests that would inevitably sweep over his
loved ones of the West--tests that would purge, purify and prepare them for their
noble mission in life.</p>

<p n="5">And as to the world's evil plight, we need but recall the writings and sayings of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, who, more than fifty years ago, declared in terms prophetic the prime
cause of the ills and sufferings of mankind, and set forth their true and divine
remedy.  "Should the lamp of Religion be hidden", He declared, "chaos and
confusion will ensue."  How admirably fitting and applicable are these words to
the present state of mankind!</p>

<p n="6">Ours then is the duty and privilege to labour, by day, by night, amidst the
storm and stress of these troublous days, that we may quicken the zeal of our
fellow-man, rekindle their hopes, stimulate their interests, open their eyes to the
true Faith of God and enlist their active support in the carrying out of our common
task for the peace and regeneration of the world.</p>

<p n="7">Let us take heart and be thankful to our beloved <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, as we remember
his manifold blessings and unfailing care and protection, ever since the hour of his
departure from our midst.  The flames of sedition, so maliciously kindled in the
past by those who have dared to flout his will, are gone forever, and the fondest
hopes of these evil plotters are now abandoned, doomed never to revive.  He has
indeed redeemed his promise!</p>

<p n="8">It seemed not a long time ago that their agitation, so violently renewed
immediately after the passing of our Beloved, would for a time confuse the Divine
<pb n="19"/>Message of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, obscure His Covenant, retard the progress of His Cause,
and shatter its unity; and yet how well we see them all today, not through our
efforts, but by their own folly, and above all, by the intervention of the hidden
hand of God, reduced to the vilest and most humiliating position.</p>

<p n="9">And now, with the Cause purified and inwardly victorious, Its principles
vindicated, Its enemies silenced and sunk in unspeakable misery, may we not,
henceforth, direct all our efforts to collective action and constructive achievement;
and in utter disregard of the flickerings of their fast-fading light, arise to carry out
those urgent measures that will secure the outward and complete triumph of the
Cause?</p>

<p n="10">I for my part, as I look back on the unfortunate circumstances of ill-health
and physical exhaustion that have attended the opening years of my career of
service to the Cause, feel hardly gratified, and would be truly despondent but for
the sustaining memory and inspiring example of the diligent and ceaseless efforts
which my fellow-workers the world over have displayed during these two trying
years in the service of the Cause.</p>

<p n="11">I cherish the hope that, from now on the Beloved may bestow upon me all the
strength and vigour that will enable me to pursue over a long and unbroken period
of strenuous labour the supreme task of achieving, in collaboration with the friends
in every land, the speedy triumph of the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  This is the prayer
I earnestly request all my fellow brethren and sisters in the Faith to offer on my
behalf.</p>

<p n="12">Let us pray to God that in these days of world encircling gloom, when the dark
forces of nature, of hate, rebellion, anarchy and reaction are threatening the very
stability of human society, when the precious fruits of civilisation are undergoing
severe and unparalleled tests, we may all realise more profoundly than ever, that
though but a mere handful amidst the seething masses of the world, are in this day
the chosen instruments of God's Grace, that our Mission is most urgent and vital
to the fate of humanity and, fortified by these sentiments, arise to achieve God's
holy purpose for mankind.</p>

<salute>The dearly-beloved ones of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> throughout Australia, New Zealand,
Tasmania, and the adjoining islands of the Pacific.
<lb/>
Friends and heralds of the Kingdom of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>!</salute>

<p n="1"><pb n="20"/>A fresh breeze, laden with the perfume of your love and devotion to our beloved
Cause, was wafted again from your distant southern shores to the Holy Land,
and has served to remind us one and all of that unquenchable spirit of service and
self-sacrifice which the passing of our Beloved has in these days kindled in almost
every corner of the world.  The letters now and then received from those faithful
untiring pioneers of the Cause of God Mr. and Mrs. H. Dunn, are in themselves
not only a convincing testimony of the ever-advancing Faith of God, proclaimed
by <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, but set as well a magnificent example to those who yearn and
endeavour to further His Cause and adhere faithfully to <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> last
instructions.</p>

<p n="2">The progress of your labours, however modest and inconspicuous at first, the
world and all the forces therein can never resist; and the Spirit of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>
working so amazingly through every one of you the changes and chances of this
distracted world can never quench.  You are assuredly of those few, yet highly
favoured, harbingers of the new Day of God, towards the establishment of which
the world in its distress and turmoil is fastly, though unconsciously, moving on,
and the full triumph of which, if it be His Will and Desire, I trust, you will all
witness.</p>

<p n="3">I pray that your meeting and collaboration with our beloved Martha Root,
that admirable and zealous disciple of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, will stimulate and advance
your work, fortify your spirit, and reinforce your endeavours to penetrate fields,
hitherto unexplored, wherein you may achieve signal victories.  My ardent prayer
at His sacred Shrine is that your vision of so great and precious a Cause may
never grow dim, that your convictions may never falter, that you may continue,
steadfast, radiant and undaunted, your task so nobly begun, and achieve in the
fullness of time its destined and glorious consummation.</p>

<p n="4">In this prayer join me the bereaved Ladies of the holy household whose eyes
are turned tenderly and expectant towards you, seeking and finding in every one
of you the alleviation of their grief at the Beloved's sudden departure, and the hope
for the triumph of a Cause for which He laboured and gave His life.  That you will
guard His trust and achieve His victory, we are firmly convinced, and together
with this expression of our confidence and firm belief may we convey to you all a
measure of our undying love and deep affection.</p>

My dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> sister, Martha,</salute>

<p n="1">Your interesting letter of Sept. 10th written to our dear Shoghi Effendi
arrived yesterday and gladdened his dear heart.  He appreciates very highly
<pb n="21"/>your sacrificial efforts in spreading the divine teachings in those distant
countries and prays for your success very affectionately.</p>

<p n="2">Today he instructed me to write a few words and inform you of the
receipt of your letter and assure you of his great love for you.  As to the plan
of your future journeys he wishes you to follow the dictates of your pure
heart.  Depend entirely on the guidance of our Beloved, <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> who
will guide you whether to travel alone or with sister Effie Baker.<note n="7" type="foot">Euphemia Eleanor "Effie" Baker (1880 -- 1968) was the first Australian woman
to become a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> having met Clara and Hyde Dunn in Melbourne late in
1922.  She was an artist, model maker, and photographer, who having travelled
Australia and New Zealand with Martha Root in 1924, decided to join the first
New Zealand pilgrims to the Holy Land, and remained in Haifa as hostess at
The Western Pilgrim Hostel 1925 -- 1936.  She assisted Shoghi Effendi, in addition,
as photographer, and as first keeper of the International Archives.  Early volumes
of <bibl><title level="j">The <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World</title></bibl> include numerous of her photographs of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
monument gardens on Mt. Carmel.  During 1930 -- 31 Effie travelled through
<w type="dw"> Iraq</w> to Persia, to make at Shoghi Effendi's request a photographic record of
Sites and relics associated with the origins of the <w type="dw">Babi</w> and <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> religions.
These were shortly after published with Shoghi Effendi's translation into English
of <bibl><title><w type="dw">Nabil's</w> Narrative</title></bibl>.  Effie returned to Goldsborough in February 1936, where
she remained until moving to Sidney in 1963.  She shied from publicity and
from any celebration of her unique life experience and achievements.  In 1981 -- 82
her work was included in a national exhibition, <bibl><title>Australian Women
Photographers 1890 -- 1950</title></bibl>.</note>  Shoghi
Effendi prays for her confirmation too.</p>

<p n="3">He is very glad to hear that our brother Mr. Dewy<note n="8" type="foot">Bertram Dewing.</note> is wonderfully
confirmed in the realisation of his high aspirations in service to the Cause
of God.  He especially prays at the Holy Shrines for his success and wishes
you to convey to him his affectionate <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> greeting.</p>

<p n="4">Shoghi Effendi also instructed me to send twenty pounds to you through
our brother Roy.<note n="9" type="foot">Roy Wilhelm.</note>  This is meant as a little contribution towards your comfort
in travelling.</p>

<p n="5">The G. H. Leaf and the other members of the Holy Family are sending

<salute>To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful in Melbourne,
Perth, Sydney, North Adelaide, Auckland and Hobart.  Care of the dearly
beloved servants of God,
<lb/>
Mr. and Mrs. H. Dunn, Melbourne, Australia.
<lb/>
My dearly beloved brothers and sisters in <w type="dw"> Abdu'l-Baha</w>!</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The fragrant messages of love, of loyalty and hope that have reached me from
that most promising land have filled my heart with gladness and have greatly
encouraged me in my work.  All praise to that magnificent spirit of fidelity and
devotion which your indefatigable spiritual parents, Mr. and Mrs. H. Dunn have
displayed for the propagation and the consolidation of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith in those
remote corners of the earth!  Their memorable services are graven upon my heart
and stand as a remarkable testimony of the undiminished potency of the creative
power of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  The marvellous accounts that have reached us of the progress
of this mighty Cause in Australia and New Zealand have stirred deeply the hearts
of the resident friends in the Holy Land and have been broadcasted throughout the
East, so that the harassed and long-suffering friends in Persia may be relieved and
comforted by the story of such wondrous triumphs in that far-away continent.</p>

<p n="2">Surely the hidden hand of God is directing you, His Spirit is inspiring you and
the power of His Word reinforcing every effort you make for the advancement of
His Cause.  We all feel that the promised glories of this Divine Dispensation will
ere long unfold in that remote corner of the globe and reflect its radiance on the
surrounding regions and fill the friends the world over with renewed enthusiasm
<pb n="23"/>and hope.</p>

<p n="3">I hope and pray that the members of the newly established Local Spiritual
Assemblies, whenever formed in any given locality, will initiate, each group within
its own province, a well-conceived campaign of Teaching, and will do its utmost
to protect the interests and extend the sphere of the Cause.  Should circumstances
be favourable and the friends after consultation find it feasible and practicable, I
would advise you to undertake in the days of <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> (April 21 -- May 2) the election
of the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand.  I am enclosing
a copy of my general letter to the West which will assist you in the conduct of the
affairs of the Local and National Assemblies.  What is however of paramount
importance in these days is the advancement, by every means at our disposal, of
the work of teaching that we may be able to add to our number such souls as would
give their unreserved allegiance to the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and consecrate their
lives to His service.</p>

<p n="4">The first party of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> pilgrims from Australia and New Zealand have safely
arrived and we pray that they will return to their respective fields of labour with
fresh enthusiasm and renewed vigour, determined to do their utmost for the spread
and ultimate triumph of our beloved Cause.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother &amp; Sister,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi has asked me to reply to your letters of 19th and 29th
Jan., and I also owe you a letter on my own account, and it is with great
pleasure that I take my pen in hand to write to you.</p>

<p n="2">We had a delightful visit, lasting three weeks, from the three Blundells,<note n="10" type="foot"><p>Sarah Blundell (1850 -- 1934), together with her children Ethel (1877 -- 1962)
and Hugh (1884 -- 1976), accompanied Margaret Stevenson and Effie Baker to
the Holy Land early in 1925 as the first <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> pilgrims from Australasia.  Mrs
Sarah Blundell, born in Burwell, Cambridgeshire, and raised a devout Quaker,
arrived in New Zealand with her husband and seven children in 1886.  She had
read of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> visit to London published in <bibl><title level="j">The Christian Commonwealth</title></bibl>,
and so knew something of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> teachings and had even considered
herself as being a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> when she met Clara and Hyde Dunn on their second
evening in Auckland in 1922.  Through Mrs Blundell the Dunns met many
others receptive to their message, and were able to establish a firm <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> group
in Auckland.</p>
<p>Ethel Blundel was elected to the Australian and New Zealand National Spiritual
Assembly from its establishment in 1934, until 1944.  She frequently spoke at
public meetings in Auckland and at summer schools, and into the 1940s served
on the <bibl><title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Quarterly</title></bibl> committee.
[Hugh Blundell was not a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> when he visited the Holy Land in 1925, but
joined having met and conversed with Shoghi Effendi.  He served on the National
Spiritual Assembly in the 1940s, and was closely associated with the founding
of New Zealand's Summer School.  In the 1940s he served on the Regional
Teaching Committee for New Zealand, and in 1958 was appointed an Auxiliary
Board Member.</p></note>
Margaret Stevenson and Effie Baker, whom the Holy Family and the friends
<pb n="24"/>here came to love very much.  They are very sincere and selfless souls.  We
hope you have many more such in the various groups you have founded.
Few things have contributed more to Shoghi Effendi's happiness during the
last year or two than the progress of the Cause in Australasia, thanks to your
tireless and selfless efforts.  We all hope that what has been accomplished up
till now may be but a foretaste of much greater progress in the future when
those you have been training &amp; teaching become themselves active workers.</p>

<p n="3">Martha Root is still here and will remain a few days longer.  She is
working hard at the study of Esperanto in order to equip herself still better
for her teaching and travelling work.  When she leaves here she will go to
Egypt for about a fortnight, then on to Europe where Geneva will probably
be her headquarters for 3 or 4 months.  Then she expects to go to England
and other parts of Europe.  I wish we had many such workers as she.</p>

<p n="4">We were delighted to hear about the success of your work in Adelaide
and the founding of the Assemblies there--especially that your business
manager and his wife and children have become so deeply interested.<note n="11" type="foot">Ron Cover, Hyde Dunn's manager at Nestles in South Australia, together with
his wife Irene, were among the early Adelaide <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.  Their son, Ron junior,
also became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>, and in later years lived in Melbourne.  The Covers were
members of the first Adelaide Assembly, established in December 1924.  They
moved to Brisbane in 1927, then to Sydney and Melbourne.  Mrs. Cover lost
contact with the community for a period, before reestablishing her links in
1940.</note></p>

<p n="5">Shoghi Effendi has already replied to your questions about a National
Spiritual Assembly for Australasia in his general letter to the believers there.</p>

<p n="6">We hope that it will soon be possible to start Assemblies in Sydney,
Hobart, Brisbane, and other centres.</p>

<p n="7">By the way, if you ever visit Ararat, Victoria, be sure to call on Mrs.
Edward Gray, High St.  She was my Sunday School teacher when I was a
<pb n="25"/>youngster and we have always kept up friendly relations, which were renewed
when I spent a year in Ararat as Med. Supt. of the hospital there.  At that
time I was not a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>, but Mrs Gray has since read my book on the Cause
and is considerably interested.  I am sure she would be delighted to meet
you.  Her husband is a commercial traveller and she has three grown-up
children.</p>

<p n="8">We hope and pray that the way may be opened up for you to visit
Brisbane this year, and to revisit all the centres where you have already
sown the seed, in order to water the seedlings that have taken root and to
sow fresh good seed in the prepared ground.</p>

<p n="9">We hope and pray too that the Australasian pilgrims who have just
been here may return from the Holy Shrines and from their travels with a
fresh baptism of the Spirit and with hearts aflame with the love of God,
ready to continue their work for the Cause with greater enthusiasm, wisdom
and power.</p>

<p n="10">Shoghi Effendi entirely approves of your suggestion regarding "An
International Song of Love" and hopes you will be confirmed in having it
perfected and set to suitable music.  There is one phrase in the suggested
text that I think had better be altered or omitted viz: "not by force--happiness
and force are impossible".  It is true of course that when love reigns in all
hearts violence becomes unnecessary, but the sentence as it stands does not
appear to me to be well-worded.  Both happiness and force are not only
possible but existent, and have co-existed in the world since the dawn of
history, and the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings admit that in past ages and even at the
present time Love and Justice have had to make use of force--Christ drove
the money changers from the Temple with a scourge.  Both Moses and
Muhammad resorted to military measures and various forms of punishment
and <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> both teach that under certain
circumstances the use of force in the interests of justice is not only permissible
but incumbent--in order to prevent unjust aggression.</p>

<p n="11">With this slight exception the words you have chosen seem to me
admirable.</p>

<p n="12">I am afraid I did not acknowledge the receipt of your last letter enclosing
money-order for the last lot of books you ordered from me, but I got it all
right about a month ago.  Since then I have had about 3 weeks in bed owing
to an attack of pleurisy, from which I am now convalescing.  I was in hospital
most of the time the New Zealand and Australian friends were here and so
did not see as much of them as I should have liked.</p>

<p n="13">Mount Carmel is looking its best now, adorned with the Spring foliage
and flowers.  The gardens at the Shrines of the <w type="dw">Bab</w> and the Beloved Master
are very beautiful.  Shoghi Effendi has taken a great personal interest in the
laying out and planting of these gardens which are said to be the most
<pb n="26"/>beautiful in Palestine.</p>

<p n="14">We all hope that some time Mrs Dunn &amp; you may be able to make a
pilgrimage to Haifa and I hope that sometime our Beloved Guardian may
be able to visit the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Centres in Australasia.  I should love to revisit
Australia myself and meet the friends there.  God willing, that too may
come to pass sometime.  Shoghi Effendi has most kindly invited me to make
this my headquarters for the next few months.  I may go to Europe for about
3 months in Summer, to escape the hot season here, but shall probably
return here for next winter to continue my Persian studies, translation work
and giving Shoghi Effendi some help in his correspondence.</p>

your life and work, in which Shoghi Effendi and all the Holy Family, Martha

<salute>Major Norman Macleod, Army Headquarters, Victoria Barracks,
Melbourne, Australia.<note n="12" type="foot">Major MacLeod became <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> during Martha Root's visit to Melbourne in
1924, and was subsequently Vice-President of the Melbourne Assembly.  Little
is known of him after 1926.</note>
<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to receive your letter of 11th March
and to hear that you had become a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> through the instrumentality of
Martha Root.  Martha Root has just been here and stayed fully a month in
<pb n="27"/>Haifa.  She has now gone forth again fired with fresh enthusiasm to resume
her splendid work for the Cause.  She is now in Cairo, but on 1st May will
leave for Europe.  After consultation with Shoghi Effendi, her provisional
plan is to spend the next year or two in Europe, where teachers such as she
are greatly needed.  She will probably spend 3 or 4 months in Geneva and
then to on to England, then to other European countries, including Russia,
if circumstances permit.</p>

<p n="2">With regard to your question about the "White Australia" policy, it is
clear that this policy of rigid exclusion of coloured Asiatic races from
Australia finds no justification in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Teachings.</p>

<p n="3"><w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> taught in the clearest possible way the
necessity of getting rid of all racial and national prejudices and of equal
justice for men of all races and colours.  That a white race should forcibly
annex a country previously inhabited exclusively by coloured people and
then proceed to forbid the admission of coloured people to that country--
especially a country so large as Australia, many parts of which are obviously
better suited for coloured races than for white people--is clearly unjust.</p>

<p n="4">At the same time there is undoubtedly truth in the contention that if,
in a country where a reasonably high standard of living, of culture, etc., has
been attained, people accustomed to a lower standard of life and culture are
freely admitted, and allowed unrestricted rights of commercial and industrial
competition, the standard of living and culture in that country is bound to
suffer.</p>

<p n="5">Even if we got rid of racial and colour prejudice, this economic and
cultured problem would remain.  The <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> method of solving the problem
is to educate both the white and coloured races in the teachings of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  The white races must cease to regard themselves as "superior"
and as having, by virtue of that innate superiority a right to exploit, take
unfair advantage of and even to exterminate coloured races, on the principle
of the "survival of the fittest".  They must cease to regard the colour of a
man's skin as a legitimate index of his "superiority" or "inferiority" and must
recognise that a good coloured man (of whom there are many) is better
than a bad white man (of whom there are also many).  They must adopt a
policy of even-handed justice for white and coloured people and recognise
that coloured and white people have equally the right to live and to have
access to suitable land on which to live.  If there are certain parts of the
world which by reason of climate are more suited to coloured people than
to white, then coloured people ought to have preference in rights of access
to such land, if white people have preferential rights in cooler regions, more
suited to their health and well-being.</p>

<p n="6">The "backward" races must be educated and their standard of living
and culture be raised as much as possible, their latent talents being developed
<pb n="28"/>to the fullest possible extent.  If this is done their objectionable characteristics
will disappear.</p>

<p n="7">The so-called "advanced" races however, are by no means free from
objectionable characteristics, such as commercial greed, love of domination,
materialistic conceptions, want of spirituality.  By true education and true
religion these also must be got rid of.</p>

<p n="8">When both the "backward" and the "advanced" races become educated
in this way, then such questions as the admission of coloured races to
Australian territories will no longer be settled by certain people who have
seized such territory dictating to the rest of the world who shall be allowed
admission to it, but by an impartial international tribunal in which all
sections of the human race shall be fairly represented and which will consider
the pressure of population in various regions, the suitability of various regions
for the habitation of different peoples, etc., and decide what is best in the
interests of humanity as a whole.</p>

<p n="9">For the satisfactory solution of any one such question we need the
progressive application of <emph rend="underscore">all</emph> the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> principles.  For instance in this case
it is clear that racial and national prejudices must be abolished, that universal
education is necessary, that a universal league of nations must have an
authority superseding that of any one nation, that impartial arbitration must
be substituted for domination by powers which are backed by strong armies
and navies, that an international language is needed to promote international
understanding, that materialism and selfish greed must be replaced by true
religion and mutual love, and so on.</p>

<p n="10">The ideals of the Oneness of God, the oneness of religion and the
oneness of humanity must be instilled into the minds of the children
throughout the world, and when a generation grows up thoroughly imbued
with these great ideals, the solution of the economic and political problems
that now cause so much misery, strife and even blood-shed in the world will
become easy.</p>

<p n="11">Meantime in political and economic matters, compromise is necessary
but we must use our influence to see that the compromise is ever being
modified and advanced in the direction of justice for all--not in the direction
of the exclusive advantage of one section of the world's population over
others.</p>

<p n="12">We are delighted to hear of the growth of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Group in
Melbourne.  In the growth of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> movement, it seems to me, lies the
hope of the world for the solution of all the problems that now vex and
trouble it.  It is very encouraging to note not only the steady increase in the
number and size of our <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> groups, but the steady trend of public opinion
throughout the world towards acceptance of the great fundamental principles
laid down sixty years ago by <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  There are backward eddies in the
<pb n="29"/>current, of course, and this "White Australia" policy seems to me to be one
of them, but on the whole the progress of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> principles seems to me to
be amazing during the last half-century and this to me is one of the clearest
proofs of the true prophethood of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.</p>

<p n="13">From your name I presume that either you or your parents hail from
the same side of the Tweed as myself.  My native town is Aberdeen.  The
name of Norman MacLeod was a highly honoured one in Scotland in my
childhood's days and is still.  Are you a near relative of the great Presbyterian
Divine we used to hear so much about?</p>

<p n="14">Shoghi Effendi is looking forward to meeting Rev. D. Millar of
Melbourne.  We had a delightful visit from Effie Baker of Melbourne and
four New Zealand friends.  They spent about 3 weeks here and then went
on to England.</p>

<p n="15">Shoghi Effendi and the friends here join in warmest regards and best
wishes to yourself and all the friends in Melbourne especially to Mr. and
Mrs. Dunn, who are doing such fine work for the advancement of the Cause.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to receive this morning your letter of
28th April, but we were very sorry to hear you have been ill and hope your
health will soon be completely restored.  It was nice that you saw Shoghi's
sister and Soheil's brother in London.</p>

<p n="2">I forget whether I gave you the address of Mr and Mrs King, c/o Messrs
Hayman and King, 202 Old Christchurch Rd. Bournemouth.  They are very
kind-hearted <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> and will be delighted to see any of you if you call.
Both of them work in the business and you are most likely to see them if you
call there.  They live above the shop.</p>

<p n="3">I gave you Sister Challis's<note n="13" type="foot">Grace Challis (d.1948), long serving member of the National Assembly of
the British Isles.</note> address at West Moors (Ferndown Lodge).
You can get there by 'bus from Bournemouth Sq. or Lansdowne, which will
drop you right at Sister Challis's door (She keeps a nursing home) or you
can go by train from West Bournemouth to West Moors station which is
within 5 minutes' walk of Ferndown Lodge.  I hope you will be able to see
her.</p>

<p n="4">As I write, the Greatest Holy Leaf is on a visit to the Shrine of the
Master.  It is over a year, I think, since she has been able to visit the Shrine
and until now she has not seen the new Gardens, in the laying out of which
<pb n="30"/>Shoghi Effendi has taken such a deep interest.  The Gardens are looking
lovely now and it is easy to imagine how delighted she will be.  One day
during the feast of <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> she and the Holy Mother were able to visit <w type="dw">Bahji</w>
and the Garden of <w type="dw">Ridvan</w>.</p>

<p n="5">I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am steadily regaining
my strength.</p>

<p n="1">The Greatest Holy Leaf and Shoghi Effendi have asked me to answer
on their behalf your kind letters of Apr. 2nd from Port Said and April 14th
from London.</p>

<p n="2">We were sorry to hear that Mrs Blundell got a chill on the steamer and
was laid up for a few days after her arrival in London.  We hope that by this
time she is all right again.  We had a note from her from Bournemouth.</p>

<p n="3">You will be glad to hear that the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy
Mother were able to motor to <w type="dw">Bahji</w> and <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> one day during the Feast of
<w type="dw">Ridvan</w>, and that yesterday the Greatest Holy Leaf motored to the Shrine of
<w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> and saw the new Gardens in which Shoghi Effendi has been
taking so much interest.</p>

<p n="4">Yesterday a Dutchman arrived here from Port Said, the first Dutch
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w>, so far as we know.  He has been a sincere and earnest truth-seeker for
years.  About 9 months ago he left his home at the Hague and walked on
foot through Belgium, France and Italy.  Then he felt some inward urge to
go to Egypt, and travelled thither by a Dutch Cargo Steamer.  When the
steamer arrived at Port Said Mahmood Effendi, one of the Port Said <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
came on board and was introduced to Mesdag (the Dutchman).  They struck
<pb n="31"/>up a friendship at once and after 2 days Mesdag went to live in Mahmood's
house.  There he met Martha Root, Mr Schopflocher<note n="14" type="foot">Siegfried Schopflocher (1877 -- 1953) was for many years a member of the NSA
of the United States and Canada, and later appointed Hand of the Cause.  Shoghi
Effendi named him "Chief Temple builder" for his role in the construction of
the Wilmette <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w>.</note> and various other
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,read my book and became thoroughly interested and seems now
already a firm believer.  He has already, since his arrival yesterday morning,
translated our 8-page folder into Dutch and we hope he will be able to do
much to make the Cause known in Holland and win adherents there.</p>

<p n="5">I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am feeling almost as
vigorous as before the attack.  <w type="dw">Azizu'llah</w> <w type="dw">Bahadur</w> is now in Stuttgart.  There
is as yet no improvement in his hand, but he is having skilled treatment
now and we hope it will be successful.  He seems to be having a very happy
time with the German friends.</p>

<p n="6">Shoghi Effendi is much in need of rest, but fairly well.  He and all the
members of the Holy Family join in loving greetings and heartfelt prayers
for your welfare.  We hope you will have a fine time in England and return
to New Zealand refreshed and reinvigorated physically and spiritually to
take up your work for the Kingdom there with new enthusiasm and devotion.
We pray that you may always be guided and strengthened by the Divine
Confirmations.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi has asked me to reply to your kind letter of 11th April.
He is delighted to hear that you propose starting a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Magazine for
Australia and New Zealand and suggests as a suitable title <bibl><title level="j">The Herald of
<pb n="32"/>the South</title></bibl>.  Every 19 days a letter will be sent from Haifa to Mr. and Mrs.
Hyde Dunn giving the news of the Cause.  Owing to the restricted facilities
for multiplying copies which are at present available here, I fear it will not
be possible to send another copy to you, but doubtless you can arrange with
Mr. and Mrs. Hyde Dunn to have their copy passed on to you for the
magazine.  We are glad to hear that notwithstanding the absence of the
Blundells and Margaret Stevenson the friends in New Zealand are remaining
united and active.  We hope that when the pilgrims return the faith and
enthusiasm of the believers will be greatly deepened and strengthened and
that many new believers may be attracted.  I had a long letter from Effie
Baker yesterday.  She is very devoted and whole-hearted and will be a valuable
worker for the Cause, I think, and a great help to Father and Mother Dunn.
When she wrote, Margaret Stevenson had gone to Scotland and Mrs. and
Miss Blundell were in Bournemouth.  Effie Baker hopes to make a return
visit to Haifa on her way back to Australia.</p>

<p n="2">Shoghi Effendi assures you of his prayers on behalf of your mother,
yourself and all the Australasian friends and his hopes that the proposed
magazine may greatly help the spread of the Glad Tidings in Australia and
New Zealand.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi asks me to thank you on his behalf for your letter of
14th May.  He received the letter of Mrs Amy Thornton<note n="15" type="foot">Mrs. Amy Thornton was a member of Melbourne community from 1923.  She
lived in South Yarra, and in 1925 was elected to the Melbourne Assembly.  As
corresponding secretary, she wrote "unity letters" to <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities in other
countries.  She also contributed articles to the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl>.  By February
1933 she had lost contact with the Melbourne <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</note> all right.  I
<pb n="33"/>remember answering it for him some weeks ago, so you can set your mind at
rest on that score.</p>

<p n="2">The recovery of your <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> ring and stones was very remarkable.  It
reminds me of a somewhat similar occurrence in Bournemouth.  One of our
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> friends had her <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> ring stolen, and nothing was heard or seen of
it for some months.  Mr King, another of our group, has an antique shop in
Bournemouth and one day his partner (a <w type="dw">non-Baha'i</w>) bought a ring from a
man who said it was his wife's, but as they had become very badly off she
wanted to sell it.  When Mr King saw the ring he recognised it as a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
ring and knowing that this friend had lost her ring, he sent it to me.  It
turned out to be her ring and she was delighted to recover it.  The curious
thing is that out of dozens of jewellers and antique shops in Bournemouth
to which the ring might have been taken for sale, it should be taken to the
one where there was a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> who recognised it.</p>

<p n="3">I hope that before you leave Scotland you may be able to go to Aberdeen
and see my home people.  They would be delighted to see you.  My father's
address is Fairford, Cults, (about 3 miles from Aberdeen, by car or train).
He is 86 years of age and rather frail.  My sister looks after him.  My two
married brothers are Peter Esslemont, 21, Louisville Avenue and W. D. E.,
12 Wellbrae Terr. Mannofield.  Both of their houses are near the Mannofield
Car Line.</p>

<p n="4">We were very glad to hear of your meetings with the friends of London
and West Moors.</p>

<p n="5">Many thanks for your letter to myself and the excellent snapshots
enclosed.  I am glad you have fallen in love with Sister Challis and hope you
will see her again before you leave.  I had a delightful letter yesterday from
Miss Kilford of West Moors, whom I regard as a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> granddaughter, as
she was brought into the Cause by Sister Challis who calls me her <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
father!</p>

<p n="6">We hope Shoghi Effendi will get away soon for a much needed rest.
The Greatest Holy Leaf was rather seriously ill all last week, but is a good
deal better again, although very feeble and frail.</p>

<p n="7">I have been advised by the Drs to leave Haifa for the summer months,
as my breathing has lately been troublesome and they think the moist heat
during the summer here would be bad for me.  On the same day on which
this decision was arrived at, I received a cordial invitation to go to a place
in the Black Forest for my summer vacation.  The Drs considered this place
would be ideal for me and that the sooner I got away the better, so I leave in
3 days time.  My address will be c/o Frau Victoria von Sigsfeld, Husli
Finsterlingen, bei St Blaisien, Baden, Germany.  I hope to return to Haifa in
the latter part of Sept. to resume my work here.</p>

<p n="1">I am so sorry to have had to delay my answer to your welcome letter of
Sept. 3rd for such a very long time.  In fact it was not that I delayed but was
unable as I received your letter only a short while ago.  All during the summer
that I was away from Haifa privileged to be with Shoghi Effendi while he
was taking a rest, the mail was sent over to us except your letter which
through inadvertence was kept until my return.  It is for having not yet written
since my return last October that I must beg your kind forgiveness.</p>

<p n="2">I am so sorry that the answer to your mail did not reach you as I knew
Shoghi Effendi did answer.</p>

<p n="3">You had asked in connection with the subject of prohibition.  Of course
in every country one must take into consideration the exact conditions as
to whether by force of legislation people can be stopped from drinking, but
as a principle the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Teachings are quite against drinking, intoxicating
liquors and from the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> point of view every thing that helps to stop
drinking is welcomed.</p>

<p n="4">As to the Scout movement, they afford a great disciplinary lesson to
the young boys and girls provided they are not prepared directly for the
army.  In some towns here we have in some of the schools Scout troops who
are also students of the colleges and it was proved to be a great educational
scheme for helping the development of the children but they are never
taught to carry arms or even the use of firearms.  And furthermore they are
often taught the evils of war rather than encourage them to become in
<pb n="38"/>future active soldiers with imperialistic designs.  This of course is my own
personal view.  I am so glad to know that your children are taking a more
active interest in the Cause and Shoghi Effendi trusts that they will in future
be able to render great services to our dear Cause.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter to Shoghi Effendi and the enclosed one to Ruhi with the
postal order for L10 have been received and read with keen interest and
pleasure.</p>

<p n="2">We are all very happy to know that you have had such a pleasant journey
back home and that you had the opportunity of delivering the message on
so many occasions.  We hope and pray that the seed you have sown has
fallen on fertile soil and that in time it will grow and bear abundant fruit.</p>

<p n="3">We hope that now through your sustained zeal and effort new life will
be infused into your small <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> group, and that it will in the near future
grow sufficiently in number to enable you to form an Assembly the first to
be established in that land.  We shall all pray at the Holy Threshold for your
guidance and the success of your work.</p>

<p n="4">The Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy Mother remember you well, and
they and the other members of the family send their loving greetings to you.</p>

<p n="5">You will be interested to know that the new pilgrim house is being
completed, and it will be all ready in a month's time for the new pilgrims
that will come.</p>

<p n="6">We still have our dear sister Effie Baker with us, and we all love her so,
she is so sweet and helpful.</p>

<p n="7">We have just now two American lady friends with us, Auntie Victoria

expecting some more soon.</p>

<p n="8">I always remember the happy day I spent with you and Effie in London
and shall look forward to the pleasure of meeting you again some day--
perhaps here in Haifa or in New Zealand, who knows?</p>

<p n="9">I am back at home now for the present, and am trying to help Shoghi
Effendi a little in his enormous task.</p>

<p n="10">He is keeping in good health I am glad to say in spite of his many
activities and heavy and manifold responsibilities.</p>

<p n="11">To you he sends his brotherly love and the assurance of his prayers for
your welfare and happiness.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated June 26th 1926.  We should not in the least be discouraged if we see
that the Cause is not making the movement we desire.  At the beginning of
every such institution difficulties are found &amp; discouragements seem to
abound.  The people do not seem so receptive, those who approach seem
not to get satisfied &amp; soon leave the fold.  The few that remain are bothered
with so many personal troubles that one could scarcely depend on them.
But all such things should add to our zeal rather than damp our energy.</p>

<p n="2">The Cause has been comparatively recently established in those regions.
The things already accomplished seem marvellous to those who are at a
distance &amp; see the ensemble of the work done rather than any particular
phase of it.  We have to take courage and persist in the pursuit of our purpose.
Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers.  He will always
remember the Australian friends &amp; beseech for them divine guidance &amp;
spiritual prosperity.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi has been in receipt of your interesting letter dated June
7, 1926.  It is a great pity that your health has more or less handicapped you
in your service to the Cause.  We, however, hope that this weakness will
soon vanish and your health and strength be fully restored.</p>

<p n="2">The case of the teacher who has been in Palestine is one really to be
lamented.  All such persons instead of procuring their information from the
very source, when they are so near to it, they go to the Missionaries who are
undoubtedly biased.  They are immediately told that the Cause is nothing
more than a sect of Islam; a movement that may do immense good to the
Muhammadan world, but far from ranking with Christianity or satisfying its
need.  Then they refer this ignorant and innocent person to books such as
Brown's.  It is their fault for having gone to the wrong source for proper
information, but once they have gone it is not their mistake to have them
mislead.  We have heard of many such instances and there is absolutely no
remedy except to leave them until they find the truth for themselves.  We
can only pray for their guidance.</p>

<p n="3"><pb n="42"/>Shoghi Effendi always prays for you as well as the other Auckland friends,
so that through your combined efforts the Cause may prosper there, and
obtain a strong position in the life of the people.  I am not the least familiar

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
June 7, 1926.  It was most interesting to go over your circular letter and read
the many points of interest.  I was especially struck by the literature you have
sent to Lord and Lady Allenby.  If they have at all seen them I am sure they
were much impressed, for they knew the Master so well.  They were surely
very astonished to see a group of <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> formed in such a distant land.</p>

<p n="2">I am very ashamed of myself not to have yet answered your letter of
some months ago.  It was mainly because Shoghi Effendi wrote you and
acknowledged the receipt of your contribution for the pilgrim house that I
have been so neglectful.  I took Miss Baker's advice on the matter and together,
we went down-town and bought a set of straw chairs.  We thought that would
be most appreciated by the friends while sitting in the veranda of the new
Pilgrim House.</p>

<p n="3">I remember a prayer, which you wrote, has been asked by a certain friend
to be read daily.  I believe sometimes the friends through their zeal &amp; ardour
do things that are not asked in the Cause.  We have only one prayer that we
have to say daily.  No one in the world has the power, given to him by
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, to add another to that daily prayer.  If we should admit this the
life of the friends will soon be spent in mere prayer, which is not the aim of
the Cause.  The healing prayer and such ones are only for occasional use.
When the need for them arises.</p>

<salute>Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister, Mrs Dewing</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Our beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you for him.  He is very
pleased with your letter of Dec. 8th, which reached him in Jan 10th and he
is very glad to hear of your activities in New Zealand.  He will pray earnestly
that your sincere efforts to make <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Revelation widely known
<pb n="49"/>will bring forth much fruit and have a great result.  In the newer countries
minds are more open, &amp; the people more ready and willing to receive this
great message.</p>

<p n="2">With regard to the Queen of Rumania's 3 articles, he will see that you
receive them correctly.  He considers the last one in which she acknowledges
Muhammad as a true Prophet of God to have great importance for the East,
especially in Persia.  This evening, personally, have had a most interesting
conversation with Dr. <w type="dw">Habib</w> of <w type="dw">Kermanshah</w>, who is now on a visit to Shoghi
Effendi with his wife and little girl.  He was telling us of the Moslims of
Persia--&amp; how during two periods of the year especially, the fanatical mullahs
preach against the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> from their pulpits--saying to the ignorant "no
matter what evil things you have done during your life, or what sins you
have committed, if you kill a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> who is an enemy of Islam, or even if you
take his property or severely injure him all your own sins will be wiped out
and forgiven for the sake of this good deed of destroying such an enemy of
the Faith!!"  In this way they incite the people to deeds of violence and
persecution.  He said that the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings are spreading rapidly amongst
the more educated classes, but it is difficult to teach the very poor and
ignorant fanatical people.  Thus when they do become Believers they are
very strong and faithful.</p>

<p n="3">The two periods of particular danger for the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in Persia, are the
fast month--&amp; the period of Moharram, which lasts for 8 weeks.</p>

<p n="4">Shoghi Effendi is very interested to hear of the engagement of your son
to a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> young lady--and he prays that in future they may do a great work
for the "Cause".  He hopes so much that you will recover your full health
and strength, and he will pray especially for that.  It is good to know that
Esperanto is increasingly studied in New Zealand.</p>

<p n="5">He will certainly pray for Miss Palter &amp; your mother as you ask him to
do--and also for your dear son and your two daughters.  Please accept all best
wishes from myself and believe me,</p>

indeed everywhere in Australia.  He will certainly pray most earnestly for

and that you both may be strengthened and spared for many years to continue
your great work in that continent.  Our dear Effie Baker tells us that Perth is
not only a very beautiful place but extremely healthy and we therefore hope

University, as master in the Grammar School, teaching science and
mathematics there.  The school authorities greatly desired he should remain
in Rockhampton, but my mother was in very poor health, &amp; he had faithfully
promised to return to England at the end of three years, and consequently
he felt obliged to fulfil his promise to her but he always looks back with the
greatest interest to his 3 years of residence in Rockhampton.</p>

<p n="4">When I return to England I will enquire if he ever met Mrs Wicus tho
I suppose it is not very probable.  It encourages us all to hear of the blessed
confirmations you have received in the path of God.  May you ever be guided

<salute>Dear Father &amp; Mother Dunn,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">I am directed by Shoghi Effendi to thank you so much for your kind
letter of Feb. 19th sent through our dear friend Mr. Bertram Dewing.</p>

<p n="2">He was pleased to hear from you and he is grateful for your loving
solicitude in connection with his recent illness.  He is happily quite well
now and again busy at his work, as is the Greatest Holy Leaf who was also
seriously unwell lately but who although still very weak, is feeling much
better.</p>

<p n="3">It gave Shoghi Effendi great pleasure to know that the work in Australia
is progressing and that more &amp; more new people join to share our faith and
our labours.  He prays earnestly that before long the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia
and New Zealand may contribute increasingly in service to the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith
and may establish progressive and enthusiastic centres throughout the whole
Continent.  We might be very far away from you, but often if not always
friends both in the East and West think or talk and love to meet their fellow-workers
across the seas &amp; needless to say they never forget the glorious
share you can claim.</p>

<p n="4">Mr Dewing is still with us and it is such a pleasure to have him.  Let us
hope some day you too will come.</p>

A letter from you always imparts joy &amp; strength to my heart.  You are the

shall utter with veneration &amp; praise in the days to come.  Your memory is immortal.
Your services are graven upon my heart.  I will continue to pray for both of you as
well as for your dear, spiritual children throughout Australasia.  Be happy always.

<salute>Dear Mr. Dunn:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated June 22nd 1930.  Concerning the condition of the Cause in Australia,
the constant endeavour of the friends should be to spread the Cause.  Once
new members begin to come in, they will inspire the friends with more
courage &amp; hope &amp; make them forget their petty differences.  Shoghi Effendi
will sincerely pray for you &amp; hopes that God will guide you to ultimate
success.</p>

<p n="2">Concerning the different translations of the words.  It is surely the
original text that should never be changed.  The translations will continue
to vary as more &amp; better translations are made.  Shoghi Effendi does not
consider even his own translations as final, how much more translations
made in the early days of the Cause in the West when no competent
translators existed.</p>

<p n="3">Concerning the two prayers in the last edition of the prayerbook.  You
had better write about it to the National Assembly in America.  Quite a
number of objections were already made &amp; I am sure they will be glad to
receive any you have for corrections to be made to future editions.</p>

<p n="4">Most of the prayers and Tablets published in the West have to be revised
by some board of translators.  But when that will be, no one knows.
Meanwhile the friends have to be satisfied with what they can obtain.</p>

<p n="5">Concerning the New History Society.  Though it is run by some <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,
yet the N.S.A. has announced--&amp; Shoghi Effendi has approved their action
--that they have no relation with the Cause.  Because the Society persists
in its refusal to abide by the decisions of the N.S.A. it does not deserve the
help of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.  It is not the first case of <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> going at a tangent
from the proscribed teachings of the Master.  Our attitude should be impartiality
rather than hostility.  Shoghi Effendi hopes &amp; prays that those who are
responsible for this society will be sorry for their attitude and will come
back under the banner of the movement.</p>

<p n="6">In closing may I assure you &amp; Mrs. Dunn of Shoghi Effendi's loving
greetings.  He will remember you and all the other Australian friends in his
prayers and ask for you divine guidance and conformation.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Dunn,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated May 17th 1931.  He was naturally very glad to hear that Mrs. Dunn is
planning to come to Haifa, for he is always desirous to meet those self
sacrificing souls who leave their homes, &amp; travel in a foreign country merely
to spread the message and do pioneer work.  They are the seed sowers who
experience only the drudgery.  Those who follow are the easy-going reapers
<pb n="60"/>who are constantly encouraged by the sight of the increasing produce.
Anyhow Shoghi Effendi is only too glad to extend to Mrs. Dunn a hearty
welcome, but would urge her to so plan her trip as to be here next spring--
some time in March or April.</p>

<p n="2">Shoghi Effendi was very sad to hear that the progress of the Cause in
Australia is far from what it should have been.  He, however, hopes that the
condition will soon change.  When the friends are not kept busy with
constant service, &amp; do not find success to keep up their spirit, they naturally
become depressed &amp; start to criticise each other.  The only remedy is
constructive work, that is teaching.  Let them concentrate upon that and
they will soon forget their mis-understandings, &amp; find themselves co-operating
in the same pursuit.</p>

<p n="3">Please convey to all of them Shoghi Effendi's loving greetings &amp; assure
them of his prayers.  He sincerely hopes that they will do their utmost in
spreading the Cause in that land.  Please remember him also to Mrs. Dunn
&amp; extend to her a hearty welcome.</p>

Dear Mrs. Ransom-Kehler:</salute>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated October 22nd, 1931 written from Melbourne.  He sincerely hopes that
this trip around the world you are taking will bear wonderful fruits &amp; many
seeking souls be attracted to the Faith.  The Master often repeats in His
Tablets that the teachers should like the morning breeze pass over the
different cities &amp; bring new life &amp; energy to its people.  The friends often
need a reawakening &amp; this is one of the tasks to be fulfilled by the travelling
teachers.  This is the greatest work Miss Root is doing &amp; the kind of service
she is rendering to the Cause.</p>

<p n="2">Besides encouraging the friends in the pursuit of their work Shoghi
Effendi hopes that you are attracting many souls through your public
speeches.  You are very well fitted for that kind of work &amp; in the East especially
India &amp; Burma there is much need for it.  We constantly hear the call for
teachers from India.  The people are opening their eyes to the need for basic
reforms &amp; are ready to give an attentive ear to the one who has really
something to say.  This is especially true of those who are educated &amp; have
come in contact with the West in more than a superficial way.</p>

<p n="3">Shoghi Effendi is sure that the friends in India &amp; Burma will avail
themselves of the chance presented &amp; obtain for you nice openings into
important &amp; cultural circles.</p>

these are such difficult days that we should not be astonished &amp; discouraged
if our plans fail.  He hopes however that on your way you will meet the
friends, especially those in Port Said, for we have no centers in Malta &amp;
Colombo.</p>

<p n="2">He was also very sorry to hear that Bertram has to give up his studies &amp;
return home.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that this period he spent in America
would be itself an education that would help him in his work in serving the
Cause.  His activities with the young people there should have made him
very experienced &amp; have deepened his understanding of the Faith.</p>

<p n="3">I believe Mrs. Dunn is planning to come this spring for a visit to Haifa.
Perhaps you will meet her before she starts.  Shoghi Effendi is eagerly waiting
to see this noble soul who introduced the Cause into Australia &amp; has been
so self-sacrificing in her services.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated Dec. 27th 1931 written from Sydney &amp; to express his deep appreciation
for the wonderful work you are doing.  So many of the friends have written
of your trip &amp; told us how very successful you have been.  Your first concern
should be not only to make the teachings broadcast, but also to get individual
persons accept the message and actually enter the ranks of the believers.
Both of these are important.  Public talks make the precepts of the Cause
permeate the life of the people at large, &amp; individual contact will induce
them to come &amp; help carry the work further.</p>

<p n="2">Concerning the economic teachings of the Cause: Mr. Lunt &amp; Mr.
Holley have each contributed a long &amp; interesting article on that subject
for the coming issue of the <bibl><title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World</title></bibl> which will be published in few
months.  I am sure you will find much material in them.  Even though the
Cause has much on the economic life of society, such as progressive income
tax, a high death duty &amp; consultation in industry between capital &amp; labour;
yet what it has on the international question is far more important and
interesting, especially in the light of present world problems.</p>

<p n="3">Shoghi Effendi has, after giving much thought to the words of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> &amp; the Master concerning World Unity, written a general letter
to the Western friends explaining how the Unity of Mankind is not merely
a spirit of brotherhood but an organic unity towards which the forces now
operating in the world are leading us.  In that letter you will find much
material for your talks.  It is being published in <bibl><pubPlace>America</pubPlace></bibl> in the form of a
pamphlet.<note n="26" type="foot"><bibl><biblScope type="part">The Goal of a New World Order</biblScope>, <date>28 November 1931</date>.  See <title>The World Order of

<p n="4">Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear of your work with the Maoris.  He
sincerely hopes that some real good will be achieved.  He has been
encouraging the New Zealand friends to translate Dr. Esslemont's book into
their language.  May be when that will be done some real work will be started.</p>

<p n="2">It should have been surely a delightful gathering with him &amp; Mr and
Mrs. Dunn.  We wish we had people, truly <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in spirit, who would travel
from one city to another, meet the friends, cheer their hearts &amp; stimulate
them to further activity.  They would be rendering such a service, even though
they make no speeches &amp; actually teach no one, for the keeping up of the
hopefulness &amp; spirit of the friends is an important enough job.</p>

<p n="3">Perhaps by the time you receive this letter Mrs. Dunn would be in
Haifa or on the way.  It is surely a pity that Mr. Dunn also could not take the
trip.  Shoghi Effendi would have enjoyed meeting both of these souls who
have brought the message to Australia.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter &amp;
to extend to you his loving greetings &amp; best wishes.  Mrs Dunn is now with
us staying in the Pilgrim House.  Shoghi Effendi sincerely wishes that you
were here with us enjoying the privilege of visiting the blessed Shrines with
Mrs Dunn.  Perhaps some time in the future this will come to pass for it is
sure that this is a longing you have always had &amp; deeply cherished.</p>

<p n="2">Mrs Ransom-Kehler was unable to join Mrs Dunn in Bombay and come
together to Haifa.  The plans they made for her in India were more than she
could complete during the short period she had allotted to that vast country
&amp; Shoghi Effendi advised her to prolong her stay by at least a month.  We
sincerely hope she has succeeded to achieve there as much as in some of the
principal cities in Australia.  She is surely a very competent teacher of the
<pb n="68"/>Cause, familiar with its spirit &amp; teachings &amp; quite competent to attract
others.</p>

<p n="3">Shoghi Effendi hopes that in Australia the friends will try to keep
burning the lamp she kindled.  They needed someone to come &amp; stimulate
them a little &amp; she surely achieved that task, but it is very necessary that
this enthusiasm should not be left to subside &amp; cool down.  You, who are
their father should see to it.  In his moments of prayer &amp; meditation at the
Shrines Shoghi Effendi will think of you &amp; ask God to guide and assist you
--you as well as the other friends in Australia.  Please extend his loving
greetings to all of them.</p>

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> friend:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
March 19th 1932, written on behalf of the Spiritual Assembly of Adelaide,
regarding the publication of the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl>.  Mr. B. Dewing wrote
in person to Shoghi Effendi and proposed to have it published for sometime
in Montreal in Canada as a sign of gratitude for the help Mrs. Maxwell is
going to render to it financially.  In answer to him Shoghi directed me to
write &amp; stress the importance of having it published in Australia.  That
periodical belongs to that continent &amp; should remain there as the organ of
the friends residing in those regions.  Should Mrs. Maxwell or any other
person desire to support it, they should not condition their assistance upon
such a transfer.  And Shoghi Effendi does not believe that they do expect
<pb n="69"/>such a thing for it is contrary to the interests of the Cause.  If they have the
means they would support it even though it be primarily an Australian
activity.  The sphere of our benevolence should not be limited by
geographical boundaries.</p>

<p n="2">As to whether the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl> should be published in Australia
or New Zealand, Shoghi Effendi would prefer to have this question settled
by the friends there.  He naturally trusts that in whichever of the two countries
it should be published the friends of both Australia and New Zealand would
participate in the work &amp; consider it as the organ of all those groups.  They
should be able to co-operate &amp; have on the committee members from both
countries.  Mr. Dewing has the work very near to his heart &amp; Shoghi Effendi
hopes he will play an important part in its publication.  It is always with co-operation
&amp; consultation that the interests of the Cause can be furthered.</p>

<p n="3">Please convey Shoghi Effendi's greetings to all the friends.  He will pray

<p n="1">It was with a deep sense of joy and appreciation that Shoghi Effendi
received your communication of May 20th, 1932 and he has charged me to
extend to you his heartfelt thanks.</p>

<p n="2">The new list of the Sydney <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> greatly rejoiced his heart as it clearly
showed the progress of the Cause in Australia and the zeal &amp; loyalty of the

the friends will unitedly strive to spread the Message &amp; will not let any
obstacle, of whatever nature, hinder their onward march.  The devotion
and the sincerity with which our Australian brethren have thus far served
the Cause is highly praiseworthy, and the Guardian trusts that this same
spirit will continue to animate all their spiritual activities.</p>

<p n="3">Shoghi Effendi cherishes the brightest hopes for the future of the Cause
in Sydney and he fervently hopes that the newly elected members of your
Spiritual Assembly will prove equal to their task by striving with all the
means at their disposal to teach the Cause both through publicity and
through public lectures, to create as much as they can that spirit of unity &amp;

to Mrs. &amp; Mr. Bolton,<note n="29" type="foot">Mariette and Stanley W. Bolton met the Dunns in 1925, and became <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
after meeting Keith Ransom-Kehler in Sydney in 1931.  They became two of
the community's most enterprising and spirited advocates.  Born in Adelaide,
Stanley had migrated to Ontario about 1914, where he married Mariette
Germain Roy, a Catholic French Canadian, in 1923, before returning to
Australia the following year.  The Boltons studied chiropractic in North America
1931 -- 34, and established their practice in Sydney.  They were foundation
members of the Sydney, Yerrinbool, and Kuring-gai Assemblies, and Mariette
was instrumental in the establishment of the Caringbah (later Sutherland),
Wollongong and Orange Local Assemblies.  Their property at Yerrinbool, south
of Sydney, became the Yerrinbool <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> school.  Both served on the National
Assembly, Mariette during 1948 -- 50, and Stanley from 1937 to 1958.  In 1952
Mariette took the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings to New Caldonia.  Stanley died in Orange,
N.S.W. in 1966, and Mariette continued teaching in Australia and the Pacific

Dear Mrs. Bolton,</salute>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated April 5th.  1932.</p>

<p n="2">He was very glad to learn that Mr. Bolton and yourself have found in
the spirit and teachings of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> your highest hopes and ideals.  He
hopes that you will become more and more deeply rooted in the Faith as
you pursue your studies and become thoroughly familiar with the literature
of the Cause.  The message of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> like the revelation of previous
prophets of God--and perhaps even more--is a store-house of wisdom and
learning.  The deeper we go in them, the more marvellous we find its treasures
to be.</p>

<p n="3">After such a deep study Shoghi Effendi trusts you will follow the example
of your spiritual parents Mr. &amp; Mrs. Dunn and Mrs. Ransom-Kehler, and
become active teachers of the Faith.  It is a sacred duty you bear towards
your fellow-men that, should you come to the source of a truth, you should
inform your friends and give them also the chance of realizing their highest
hopes and ideals.</p>

<p n="4">The world is passing through great tribulations.  Millions of people are
left destitute with almost no ray of hope to maintain their courage.  The key
to the whole situation is entrusted to our humble care, for we bear the message
of God to the world for we are already shown the way to salvation.  Should
we remain idle or become neglectful of our duties, then what would become
of the perishing society?</p>

<p n="5">In his moments of prayer Shoghi Effendi will remember you and Mr.
Bolton and ask for both of you, divine guidance and help.  In case you will,
in your travels, come anywhere near to Haifa, he will be very glad to receive
you and entertain you in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> pilgrim house where Mrs. Dunn is staying
at present.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter dated May 12th, that you have sent through the kindness
of Mrs. Bolton, was welcomed by the Guardian; he has charged me to
acknowledge it &amp; to extend to you his abiding gratitude for all the services
that you are rendering towards the advancement of the Faith.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian was delighted to learn, that at last, through your
admirable endeavours a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> meeting room has been established in Sydney;
your successful report of the first opening meeting, has indeed, rejoiced the
heart of Shoghi Effendi, who is looking so eagerly to receive the news of the
progress of the Faith.  He is fully aware that the Friends are laboriously at
task, spreading the teachings of our Beloved Master &amp; trying their best to
serve such an eminent Cause.</p>

<p n="3">Indeed our <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> sister Keith<note n="31" type="foot">Keith Ransom-Kehler.</note> is rendering wonderful services for the
advancement of the Faith.  Her visit to Haifa has gladdened Shoghi Effendi,
who has urged her to travel for awhile in Persia.  She is now on her teaching
tour in <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> native land, rendering remarkable services, giving the
Sacred Message to the eminent Persian leaders.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian deeply appreciates the efforts that the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Sydney
are displaying for the establishment of the Cause of God over their country,
&amp; the fulfilment of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> fondest hope: to bring the world under
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> banner.  He will pray from the depth of his heart for the success
of your efforts, &amp; will supplicate at the Holy Shrines, that the light of Divine
Guidance may illumine your path &amp; enable you to kindle in the hearts of
the people, the flame of Truth.  He has great confidence in your valuable
enterprise, &amp; values your earnestness to assist him in such a mighty task.</p>

<p n="1">Your most beautiful message of Nov. 29th, 1932, written through Miss
Hilda Brooks, your Secretary, was received and the news of the projected
formation of a National Spiritual Assembly in Australia gladdened the heart
of our Guardian.  He sincerely hopes that, through the whole-hearted
cooperation of our Australian believers, this plan will soon materialize and
will serve to coordinate the efforts of the various Spiritual Assemblies in
that continent.  The time has come, the Guardian believes, that the friends
should organise themselves into a solidly-united administrative body and in
this way increase the efficiency and the success of their teaching work.</p>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated December 16th 1933.</p>

<p n="2">What you stated as the basic teachings of this Faith is quite correct,
only you should not say that the Master, who obtained His inspiration from
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, rather than directly from God, was on the same footing as
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  The moon cannot be compared to the Sun.  And this the Master
states in His last will &amp; testament.  There he states what ought to be the
basic belief of every <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>.</p>

<p n="3">As regards the charts: what the Guardian told Mrs. Dunn was that we
should be very careful not to consider geometrical figures as expressing in
an absolutely true form what is in reality spiritual relations &amp; beyond our
comprehension.  The charts may be helpful to state some primary facts but
surely the reality has elements far beyond what they can express.</p>

<p n="4">All these points are clearly explained in books such as the <bibl><title><w type="dw">Iqan</w></title></bibl> and
<bibl><title>Some Answered Questions</title></bibl>, and the students of the teachings should be
encouraged to study them &amp; the more they study them the more will the
truth reveal itself to them.</p>

<p n="5">Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear of your services &amp; of the progress
of the Faith.  The credit for most of what has been achieved surely is yours,
for you have been <emph rend="underscore">the father of that community</emph>.  The Guardian hopes that
you will continue to render distinguished services to the Faith.</p>

<p n="6">As regards the tea-room the Guardian believes that you should confer
with the friends there who are better acquainted with the circumstances.
Anyhow you have his best wishes.  God will surely help devoted servants of
His such as you.</p>

<p n="7">Please convey Shoghi Effendi's loving greetings to Mr. and Mrs. Bolton.
<pb n="80"/>It was surely a very <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> act for them to open their home to you, God will
surely recompense him who helps the servants of His Cause.</p>

<p n="8">The Guardian will pray for them as well as for their son.  May they all
render distinguished services to His Cause.</p>

<p n="9">While visiting the blessed Shrines the Guardian will think of you &amp;
Mrs. Dunn, as well as the other friends there &amp; ask for you all divine guidance

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
dated January 27th 1933.</p>

<p n="2">As regards the changing of the pronouns in the prayers of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.
Even though the change is not so important for it makes no alteration in an
important aspect of the writings, yet it is counter to a basic principle
mentioned by <bibl><author><w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w></author> in the book of <title>Aqdas</title></bibl>.  There He prohibits in most
emphatic terms the interpolation of the Words.  It would therefore be wrong
to effect such modifications even though it is insignificant.</p>

<p n="3">It is very difficult, that having an English translation of a prayer, to
know the Persian or Arabic original of it, for <w type="dw">Baha'i's</w> prayers are many &amp;
not all compiled in one or a series of books.  It is therefore difficult to find
the original of the prayer you mention to compare it with the translation.  If
we follow the meaning of the verse we would find that the last word "world"
should be plural.  This is also a familiar expression of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> &amp; quite
true for He says repeatedly that besides this there are many worlds.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian will surely, while visiting the Shrines, pray for you &amp;
Meade Almond as well as for Ethel Dawe<note n="33" type="foot">Ethel Dawe joined the Adelaide City community in 1932.  She was an active
member of the League of Nations in Australia and was one of Clara Dunn's
close friends.  In 1938, having visited England, Geneva, and Haifa, she returned
with Shoghi Effendi's gift to the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of a lock of hair from the
head of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  That year she joined ABC radio in Adelaide, and
subsequently made some of the earliest radio broadcasts on the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith in
Australia.  From the early 1940s into the 1950s she was one of Adelaide's
Delegates to National Convention, and for a decade was a member of Adelaide
Local Spiritual Assembly.  She was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly
between 1948 and 1953.  In 1949 Miss Dawe travelled for a second time to
Europe, speaking at numerous meetings in England and attending the second
European Teaching Conference in Brussels.  On her return she frequently
participated in Adelaide's winter schools, and travelled on interstate teaching
trips.  In 1953, the year she transferred from Adelaide to Burnside community,
she chaired a post-convention "Southwest Pacific School" for pioneers departing
to Crusade goals, and in October attended the New Delhi Conference.  She
died in the second year of the World Crusade, on 18 September 1954.</note> and Hilda Brooks.  He trusts that

<p n="1">The Guardian wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter as
well as the manuscript of your thesis.</p>

<p n="2">As he has no time to go over it in person at present, he asked me to
read it &amp; give you any suggestions I have.  He will avail himself of the first
opportunity he obtains to read it through personally.</p>

<p n="3">In one connection you mention that the Garden of <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> is near Mt.
Carmel and that <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> lived in it &amp; used to go to the Mountain for
prayer.  This is incorrect.  The garden is in Acre and far from the Mountain.
Having never seen Haifa you have confused the localities &amp; different sites.
I would advise you to leave out those passages.</p>

<p n="4">Then, you mention the importance of numerology &amp; the occult sciences
<pb n="82"/>and advise that the students should be taught these things.  As you are trying
to express the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> point of view on the subject of education, it would be
far better to leave this out, for the Master discourages the study of numerology
&amp; the occult sciences instead of encouraging them.  He says there is a germ
of truth in them but that does not justify us to attribute any importance to
them.  I have mentioned this to the Guardian &amp; he also feels you had better
leave out the passage.</p>

<p n="5">Shoghi Effendi deeply appreciates your efforts in presenting the
educational program of the Faith to the public.  It is, naturally, premature
for us to say what the full &amp; considered program is, for all the Tablets have
not been collected &amp; studied, &amp; we do not know, as yet, every thing that
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> &amp; the Master have said on the subject.  The step you have taken
is therefore that of a pioneer who even though he may not achieve everything
will create enough interest to arouse others to follow his footsteps.</p>

&amp; merciful but also just.  Just as reward &amp; punishment, according to
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, are the pillars upon which society rests, so mercy and justice
may be considered as their counterpart in the world to come.  Should we
disobey God &amp; work against His commands He will view our acts in the
<pb n="85"/>light of justice &amp; punish us for it.  That punishment may not be in the form
of fire, as some believe, but in the form of spiritual deprivation &amp; degradation.
This is why we read so often in the prayers statements such as "God do not
deal with us with justice, but rather through thy infinite mercy".  The wrath
of God is in the administration of His justice, both in this world &amp; in the
world to come.  A God that is only loving or only just is not a perfect God.
The Divinity has to possess both of these aspects as every father ought to
express both in his attitude towards his children.  If we ponder a while, we
will see that our welfare can be insured only when both of these divine
attributes are equally emphasised &amp; practised.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends,</salute>

<p n="1">I have been requested by the Guardian to inform you of the receipt of
your letter dated April 24th, 1933 together with the enclosed membership
application form which you had sent for his approval.  The news of the
projected formation of an Australian National Assembly greatly cheered
his heart and confirmed his hopes for the future of the Cause in Australia
and New Zealand.  He is confident that through your perseverance,
enthusiasm and devotion great results will be achieved.  He wishes you,
however, not to be in a hurry, to proceed slowly and carefully and to follow
as closely as possible the example set by our American brethren in their
attempt to widen and consolidate the nascent institutions of the Faith in
their land.  The formation of a National Assembly is not an easy matter.  It
is fraught with incalculable difficulties.  Our Australian friends, therefore,
should act with great caution and wisdom lest they jeopardize the very best
interests of the Cause.</p>

<p n="2">Shoghi Effendi has carefully read your membership application form
for affiliation with <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New Zealand and he wishes me
to assure you that it has met with his whole-hearted approval.  In all the
<pb n="86"/>various &amp; important steps you are now taking for the formation of your
National Assembly he would strongly urge you to ask the advice of the
American National Assembly, to keep in close and constant touch with its
members who are on the whole much more experienced in matters pertaining
to the actual functioning of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> administrative institutions.  Moreover,
the volume <bibl><title><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administration</title></bibl> is an indispensable book for a thorough
understanding of the spirit as well as the form of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administrative

your letter of May 19th, 1933, written through Mr. Brewer your secretary,

to coordinate their administrative activities &amp; thereby give a new impetus

are so devotedly extending to our American brethren will increasingly draw

<p n="1">Shoghi Effendi was so glad to receive your beautiful &amp; most interesting

and to learn of your activities after such a long time.  The many news you
have given him about the progress of the Cause in Australia, together with
the suggestions you have made for its further extension and consolidation
in that continent, were thoroughly appreciated by him.  You seem to have
given him a faithful &amp; true account of the standing of the Cause in your

keep him in close &amp; constant touch with your activities.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian is firmly convinced that you can be of a great help to
the friends in Australia &amp; that your knowledge of the Cause &amp; your eagerness
to promote its principles make you specially fit to devote a good deal of your
time to the teaching of the Faith.  You should fully avail yourself of this

you is a vast &amp; endless field of teaching.  You have the energy, the courage,
&amp; the ability to undertake such a highly important &amp; most delicate task.
May <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> strengthen &amp; help you &amp; may He shower upon you His
blessings &amp; impart to your soul that peace &amp; serenity of which the world is
in such a crying need.</p>

<p n="3">Shoghi Effendi would like you also to make all your effort to increase
among the friends the spirit of unity &amp; of cooperation &amp; to encourage the
young believers to come into a closer contact with the older generation of
friends, so that through this harmonious cooperation the Cause may be
given a further chance to develop &amp; expand.  The Faith needs both the

your eagerness to spread the Holy Message &amp; your readiness to foster &amp;

needs your enthusiasm, your spirit of initiative &amp; of whole-hearted loyalty

an action meets their approval, &amp; if so to ask their assistance &amp; help for
finding the best means through which to carry out your plan.  The idea of a

the entire body of our Australian &amp; New Zealand believers.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian wishes also to stress the importance, in these days when
the Cause is making such a rapid advance in the West, of widening, as
much as resources permit, the sphere of your teaching activities as well as
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> publications.  Their standard, both intellectual &amp; artistic, should be
raised in order that through them the interest of the public in the teachings

particularly on your monthly magazine, the "<bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl> that its
subscribers may increase in number &amp; that they may encourage their friends
to read &amp; study its contents.</p>

<p n="1">On behalf of Shoghi Effendi I wish to thank you for your letter dated
Feb. 1st which you had written in the name of the Adelaide Spiritual
Assembly, expressing the difficulties which the friends are encountering in
<pb n="92"/>the formation of their N.S.A.</p>

<p n="2">As the Guardian has already intimated, the believers should in no way
consider the establishment of a National Assembly in Australia as an
impending obligation, but as an important step to be taken when
circumstances are on the whole favourable.  He is fully conscious of the
obstacles which impede the realization of this suggestion he has made to
some of our Australian &amp; New Zealand believers.  And in view of that he
would recommend the friends not to take any definite action in the matter
unless they can ascertain that their plan can be successfully carried out.</p>

<p n="3">As regards the method to be adopted for the election of the delegates
to the Convention, he feels that as the friends in Australia &amp; New Zealand
are relatively few in number it would be advisable for them to have only
nine or nineteen delegates instead of ninety-five.  And these delegates must
be elected to represent those localities where there are duly established Local
Spiritual Assemblies, and according to the principle of proportional
representation.  As to the adoption of the Membership Application Form,
the Guardian prefers to leave this matter entirely in the hands of your
National Assembly when it is formed.</p>

<p n="1">On behalf of the Guardian I wish to thank you for your much
appreciated letter of Feb. 22nd which carried the joyful news of the projected
formation of the Convention of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New Zealand,
in the middle of this coming April.  I cannot, indeed, refrain from expressing
his deep and abiding gratitude for this latest expression of the spirit of
determination, of courage &amp; of whole-hearted loyalty which is so powerfully
animating our Australian and New Zealand believers, &amp; which, in the years
to come, will enable them to forge ahead in their efforts for the establishment
&amp; expansion of the administrative order of the Faith in their country.  This
new &amp; momentous step they have been inspired to take will surely bring
<pb n="93"/>them into a closer &amp; deeper contact with the general body of the Cause, by
providing them with an opportunity to discharge, with more effectiveness
&amp; power, their manifold &amp; sacred responsibilities for the international
promotion &amp; safeguarding of the Faith.  The formation of every new National
Assembly must, indeed, be viewed as a step forward in the evolution of the
Administration of the Faith.  And not until a sufficient number of such
National Assemblies has been duly constituted can there be any hope for
the future expansion of the Cause.</p>

<p n="2">I need not remind you of the Guardian's oft-repeated urge that in the
formation of their Convention as well as in all their other activities in
connection with the election of the N.S.A. the friends must follow as closely
as possible and with due consideration to certain local differences, all the
regulations, laws &amp; principles governing the administration of the Faith in
America.  The American N.S.A. is, indeed, the prototype of all other
National Assemblies in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world.  And this, not because of any
geographical or national considerations but due to the fact that it constitutes
the oldest and the most effective organ of its kind in the field of the

<salute>Dear Miss Brooks,</salute>

<p n="1">I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of June 6th, written on behalf of the N.S.A. of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and
New Zealand, and to convey to you, and to your collaborators on that
Assembly his grateful appreciation of the stupendous efforts you have
unanimously exerted for making your first Convention such a successful
and promising meeting.  Your collective and continued sacrifices, as well as
the assistance and guidance of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> have surely been responsible for
this historic triumph which you have been able to achieve in the
administrative field of the Cause--a triumph which will inevitably bring
about a renewed and deeper spiritual consciousness to all the believers in
these far-off lands.</p>

<p n="2">Shoghi Effendi is praying from the very depths of his heart for your
guidance and assistance, and hopes that as a result your National Assembly
will be soon enabled to take such steps as would enable it to extend and to
further consolidate its national as well as international activities.</p>

<p n="3">With warm greetings to you and to all the friends in Adelaide,</p>

<salute>Dear and valued co-worker,</salute>
<lb/>
My heart is filled with joy and gratitude as a result of the perusal of your letter.
I long to be in close and constant touch with your newly-formed National Assembly
--the first of your administrative activities and the herald of one of the most fruitful
and stirring periods in the history of the Faith in that promising continent.  I will be
so glad to receive copies of the minutes of your gatherings, and urge you to keep in
close touch with your sister Assemblies throughout the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world.  I will assuredly
pray for you and your dear and devoted collaborators from the depths of my heart.

<p n="1">The Guardian has just received from the editor of the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the
<pb n="97"/>South</title></bibl> copies of your monthly magazine together with the printed report of
the first Convention of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New Zealand, and he is
deeply gratified to witness the steady advancement which your National
Assembly is making in consolidating the foundations &amp; in extending the
sphere of the administration of the Faith throughout your country.  He was
particularly impressed by the photograph of the delegates at the Convention
&amp; also by that representing the members of your newly-elected National
Assembly, both of which have been beautifully reproduced in the last issue
of the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl>.  He would be, indeed, very thankful if you
send him three copies of each of these photographs which he wishes to
place in the mansion of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> at <w type="dw">Bahji</w>.  He feels certain that the
many visitors to this hallowed spot, both believers and non-believers alike,
will be deeply impressed by them, and will be further convinced in their
recognition of the tremendous &amp; unsurpassed progress achieved by the Faith
in these far-off lands.</p>

<p n="2">In closing I wish to assure you of the Guardian's best wishes, and to
renew his grateful appreciation of your continued and pioneering services
for the Cause in Australia.  His prayers for you both, as well as for your
collaborators in the National Assembly are being continually offered to
God.  May His unfailing guidance and love continue to impart a fresh &amp;

penetration &amp; establishment of His Faith.</p>

P.S.  The Guardian wishes to remind you &amp; through you the members of
your National Assembly that in conformity with the general rule &amp; practice
among the believers and for the sake of maintaining the necessary unity in
the administrative rulings &amp; procedures of the Cause you should have your
Annual Convention held any time during the twelve days of <w type="dw">Ridvan</w>
beginning from April 21st, and not on May 15th as observed in your last
Convention gathering.
<lb/>
P.S.  Shoghi Effendi is directing the Spiritual Assembly of Haifa to incorporate
both in the English &amp; in the Persian issues of their circular letter the news
of the Convention of the Australian &amp; New Zealand friends as this news
will greatly stimulate &amp; inspire the believers all over the world.

<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The Guardian has read and carefully considered your letter of July 29th
with its enclosures, and was profoundly grieved to learn of the unfortunate
situation that has arisen between you and your Local Spiritual Assembly.
<pb n="98"/>He hopes, nevertheless, that through your exemplary self-sacrifice &amp; your
spirit of good-will this abnormal condition will be soon remedied, and that
your relations with the Assembly will take on their normal course.  In view
of that he would advise you to drop the matter entirely, to even forget it,
and to demonstrate through both your words and deeds your unqualified &amp;
whole-hearted obedience to whatever your Assembly decides &amp; acts upon.
For in so doing you will be demonstrating your loyalty not to any individual,
but to a principle &amp; to that body which incarnates &amp; exemplifies that same
principle.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian feels also that it would be more advisable if you do not
petition the National Assembly, in view of the fact that this body has much
more constructive problems before it for consideration &amp; settlement.  He
would advise you also not to insist any more on obtaining an apology from
your Local Assembly, for such an act even though it may be justified by
facts, would assuredly lower the prestige of that institution in the eyes of the
believers.  The Guardian's impression is that the whole issue is due to a
misunderstanding between you &amp; the Assembly, &amp; that in view of that it
would be preferable not to give it any more consideration than it deserves.
Such misunderstandings have invariably accompanied the birth of the
administration in every country in which it has been established, and time
has proved that through the propelling power of the Faith each &amp; all of
them have been gradually &amp; effectively wiped out.  You need, therefore,
have no misapprehension whatever.  Your action, the Guardian feels certain,
will constitute an example which the friends will thoroughly appreciate, &amp;
in the light of which they will learn to settle every problem arising between
them &amp; their Assemblies in future.</p>

<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> friend,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
<pb n="99"/>dated August 31st with its most interesting enclosures, all of which he has
carefully read and considered.  It is with deep gratification that he follows
the progress and extension of the work of your NSA, and he hopes and
prays that through the confirmations of the Almighty it will serve to give
an increasing impetus to the progress of the Faith in your land.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian has read with particular interest the minutes of the
meetings of your N.S.A.  He hopes to receive them regularly, and thus to be
in close and constant touch with your national activities.</p>

<p n="3">In regard to your question as to whether it is permissible to substitute
the plural pronoun for the singular in prayers worded in the singular, the
Guardian would strongly urge your N.S.A. to inform the friends to strictly
adhere to the text of the Holy Writings, and not to deviate even a hair-breadth
from what has been revealed by the Holy Pen.  Besides, it should be
noted that congregational prayer has been discouraged by <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and
that it is allowed only in the case of the prayer for the dead.</p>

<p n="4">Concerning the Healing Prayer, the Guardian wishes me to inform
you that there is no special ruling for its recital.  The believer is free to
recite it as many times and in the way he wishes.  There are also no obligatory
prayers for the Fast.  But there are some specific ones revealed by <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>
for that purpose.</p>

<p n="5">As to the instructions given in the little black covered Prayer Book,
they are by no means complete and are only tentative.  When the Book of
Aqdas is published, the believers will have then full and authoritative
prescriptions about the form of prayer, and other instructions and rulings of
a spiritual character.</p>

which your N.S.A. is making since its formation last year.  He is particularly
pleased and encouraged to realise how wisely and effectively your Assembly
is adjusting itself to the general conditions and specific requirements of the
Cause in Australia and New Zealand, to such an extent that obstacles which
a year ago seemed to be insurmountable have now, through the sustained
and earnest efforts of the friends, been partially if not completely removed.
Your Assembly has, indeed, truly vindicated its ability and power to function
as a well-organized and united body, and this in the face of manifold
difficulties which the all-conquering spirit of the Faith could alone overcome.
Nothing short of this Divine spirit, as expressed through the self-sacrificing
and confident labours of the Australian and New Zealand friends, could
have so effectively subdued those forces which every now and then
threatened to undermine the foundations of your Assembly, and thus
overthrow the entire system of the Administration in your land.</p>

far achieved will continue undiminished and undeterred by any obstacle,

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The Guardian has received your letter dated May 8th, and has carefully
read and considered its contents.  He wishes me to thank you for it, and
specially to convey to you, as well as to the other members of your N.S.A.,
his hearty congratulations over the success that has attended your national
elections this year.  He hopes and prays that as years go by your Assembly
will increasingly grow in unity and strength, and will demonstrate its capacity
to cope with the manifold problems and difficulties with which it will be
inevitably confronted as it forges ahead in its slow though steady progress
towards the firmer establishment of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> World Order throughout
Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p n="2">With regard to your question as to the advisability of disclosing to an
individual believer the contents of the N.S.A.'s correspondence.  The
Guardian thinks that although this cannot be considered as constituting an
obligation which a believer can impose upon the national body, yet, it would
seem highly advisable that the N.S.A. should give a sympathetic
consideration to any such request made to it by a believer.  This, he feels,
would avoid giving the impression that the Assembly is working in an
atmosphere of complete secrecy, and that it is motivated by dictatorial
motives.  The final decision in such matters, however, is entirely left to the
discretion of the N.S.A.  The basic principle that should always be
remembered is that the N.S.A. cannot be required to reveal to any outsider
all the details concerning its work.  It may choose to do so if it wishes, but
nobody has the right to enforce upon it any such action: This is, of course
<pb n="107"/>the purely legal side of the question.  But a purely legalistic attitude in matters
affecting the Cause, particularly now that the Faith is still in a state of infancy,
is not only inadequate but fraught with unforeseen dangers and difficulties.
The individuals and Assemblies must learn to cooperate and to cooperate
intelligently, if they desire to adequately discharge their duties and obligations
towards the Faith.  And no such cooperation is possible without mutual
confidence and trust.</p>

the N.S.A. and with the assurance of his prayers on behalf of you all,

<salute>[National Assembly] Beloved <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> co-worker,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">On Behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 8th of July last, with the enclosed copy of the minutes of the
N.S.A. of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New Zealand.  I wish, in particular, to
express his gratification at the news of the success of the last meeting of
your N.S.A. held in Sydney.  It gives him, indeed, much pleasure and
encouragement to realize that your Assembly meetings are conducted with
such a good deal of order and efficiency, and above all, in such a perfect
spirit of unity and fellowship--the few other obstacles and difficulties left,
he feels confident, will in due time disappear.  The foundation has been
now firmly laid down, and the work is bound to develop and expand.  The
friends should, therefore, be confident, and should exert their utmost that
the institutions they have so painstakingly and laboriously established should
flourish and yield their fruit.</p>

<p n="2">In connection with the N.S.A.'s decision regarding the appointment
of Mrs. Axford and Mr. Inman to keep records of Australian and New Zealand
activities for the <bibl><title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World</title></bibl>; the Guardian wishes you to assure your
fellow-members in the Assembly that he fully endorses their choice.  He
also wishes you to impress the newly-appointed correspondents with the
vital importance of their task, and to urge them to acquit themselves of it
<pb n="108"/>with thoroughness, efficiency and vigour.</p>

<p n="3">Regarding dear Mr. Hyde Dunn's health; Shoghi Effendi is grieved
beyond words to learn that he is growing so weak physically.  Will you kindly
assure him, as well as Mrs. Dunn, of his supplications for the amelioration of
his health and for the complete restoration of his forces.</p>

<p n="4">In closing will you also convey his love and greetings to the members
of the N.S.A. and assure them once more of his continued prayers for their
welfare, protection and guidance.</p>

The detailed report of the activities of the National Assembly--the furthermost
pillar of the Universal House of Justice which the high endeavours of the believers
in Australia and New Zealand have reared--has filled my heart and soul with
immense joy and gratitude.  The Beloved is surely watching over and continually
blessing your splendid accomplishments, the plans you have conceived, the methods
you have devised, the efforts you are exerting, the services which you have rendered.
I will continue to pray for the consolidation and uninterrupted expansion of your
laudable activities in the service of so glorious and mighty a Cause.  Never relax
nor despair.  The tender plant which your hands have raised and nurtured shall
grow and will ultimately gather beneath its shadow the whole of that far-off and

Effendi's best wishes, and of his prayers on behalf of them both.  May the

friends to contribute, as often as they can, such articles for
publication in that magazine as would serve to make it a more direct and
effective teaching medium for the spread of the Cause throughout Australia

cooperation of the American believers for that purpose, and hopes that the
response they will make to this call will be such as to further encourage you
in your splendid efforts for the publication of this national organ of the Faith

Theosophy, became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in Auckland in the 1930s.  After her 1938

visited the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> around Australia to speak of the Holy Shrines in Haifa and
<w type="dw">Akka</w>.  She made three further pilgrimages--in 1953, 1974 and 1979.  During
the Six-Year plan Miss Carpenter retired as manager of a "tea-shop" and moved
first to Sidney, then in 1948, to South Australia.  At <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> she helped form
Woodville Assembly, before moving to Perth, where she assisted the group to
achieve Assembly status at <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> 1949.  In the next four years she pioneered
in Brisbane, Rockhampton, and New Plymouth.  During the years of the World
Crusade Miss Carpenter taught extensively in New Zealand towns.  She helped
Hamilton group become an Assembly in 1960.  In 1963 she moved to Auckland,
and attended the London Congress.  After assisting the Okahune and Raetihi
communities in 1965 and Wanganui and Wellington in 1966, Miss Carpenter
attended the International Teaching Conference and the dedication of the
<w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w> in Panama, visiting Tonga and the Samoas on her return
trip.  In later years she visited other <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities: Papua New Guinea

You can be sure that the friends will be most delighted to meet her,

meeting her, and cherishes the hope that through this pilgrimage she may
receive a renewed stimulus to better work for the promotion of the Faith
upon her return home.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian has also noted with deep satisfaction the preparations
made by your N.S.A. for this year's meeting in Melbourne.  He is praying

<p n="3">What the Guardian feels it of vital importance for the friends to do is
to teach the Cause directly and by means of imparting the Holy Words.  It
is now too early to carry out any teaching activity along the lines you suggest.
Not only the number of the believers is too limited, and their resources
confined, but the situation outside, both political and economic, is such as

<p n="2">He is rejoiced to learn of the projected formation of a Spiritual Assembly

been duly constituted and will be functioning with the utmost unity,

<p n="3">In this connection he wishes me to bring to your Assembly's attention
the necessity of their taking the necessary steps for the incorporation of the
N.S.A.  This step, he feels, is of a vital importance to the further development
of your Assembly, and will no doubt give it more stability and an added
influence, specially in the eyes of the general public.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian would also advise that the Local Assemblies take a similar
step, and obtain official recognition from the authorities.</p>

<p n="5">In case the Auckland Assembly has been registered in the government,
will you be so kind as to send him photostatic reproductions of any
registration papers or documents that the Auckland friends may have
obtained from the authorities, as he wishes to have them published in the

<p n="1">Your detailed communication of July 14th written on behalf of the
N.S.A. of Australia and New Zealand together with its enclosures, have all
duly arrived, and their contents read with deepest interest and appreciation
by our beloved Guardian.  Also the photographs and blocks have duly reached
him, as well as the Local Assembly reports sent under separate cover.  Please
accept his most sincere and grateful thanks for them all.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding the proposed News Letter to be issued every three months
by your NSA; this, the Guardian feels, is a splendid idea and can render a
unique and much needed help to your Assembly in its efforts for the
establishment of the Administration and the more effective functioning of
its institutions throughout Australia and New Zealand.  Not only has it the
great advantage of keeping the friends well-informed about the events and
developments in the Cause, but in addition can help in consolidating the
organic unity of the believers by bringing them within the full orbit of the
N.S.A.'s jurisdiction.  It is hoped that this body will do its utmost to maintain
the publication of this bulletin, and will make full use of this splendid medium
for the further widening and consolidation of the foundations of the Local
as well as National Assemblies.</p>

<p n="3">As regards Mrs Bedikian's request that you assist her in her project of
uniting the believers through correspondence; this is of course a task which
is quite secondary compared to the duties and responsibilities you are called
upon to discharge as secretary of the N.S.A.  Your secretarial work in that
body imposes upon you a paramount obligation which no other service can
equal in importance.  All your other <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activities should be subordinated
to your work in the N.S.A. which is, undoubtedly, the most vital and urgent
of them all.</p>

<p n="4"><pb n="118"/>Concerning the Greatest Name; this term refers both to "<w type="dw">Allah-u-Abha</w>"
and to "<w type="dw">Ya</w> <w type="dw">Baha'u'l-Abha</w>".  The first is the form of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> greeting
and should be used, while the other is an invocation, meaning "O Thou
Glory of Glories".  These two words are both referred to as the Greatest
Name.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian, while fully aware of the difficulties, both financial and
otherwise which your N.S.A. is facing in connection with the publication
of the "<bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl>, feels, nevertheless, the urge to advise you to
continue with this magazine and not to feel in the least discouraged if your
efforts for meeting the expenses incurred for its printing and circulation,
and for raising its literary standard, do not bring the expected results.  He
very deeply values the self-sacrificing and sustained efforts exerted by your
Assembly in this connection.  May <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> richly reward you for all
your meritorious endeavours.</p>

<p n="1">Our able and indefatigable co-worker, Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher is
on a tour to Australia, India and the Near East, and by the time this letter
reaches you he may be already in your midst.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian wishes your N.S.A. to arrange for him to visit all the
centers in Australia and if possible New Zealand too, and to make every
effort to render his stay amongst you as abundant in its results as possible.</p>

<p n="3">Mr. Schopflocher is surely known to you and to many friends in
Australia.  He is truly one of the most distinguished believers in the West.
He has a deep knowledge of the Cause, and specially of the Administration,
and has contributed a unique share towards its establishment and
consolidation in the States.  For many years a member of the American
<pb n="119"/>N.S.A., he revealed such great qualities of heart and mind as very few of his
fellow-members were able to manifest.  He supported valiantly and
generously, and through both moral and financial means, the various
institutions of the Cause, and in particular the institution of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Fund which, as you can well realise, is the foundation stone of every phase
of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activity.</p>

<p n="4">In this connection it should be remembered that it was mainly due to
his unfailing and most generous assistance that the Temple in Wilmette was
built.  The friends owe him indeed a great debt, and can never be too grateful
for what he has accomplished, and is still so splendidly accomplishing, for
the Faith in the West.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian hopes, nay he feels confident, your Assembly, as well as
all the friends will extend a most cordial welcome to this dear and
distinguished Servant of the Cause, and will fully avail yourselves of this
splendid opportunity that has been offered you to further enrich the field of
your experiences in the Faith.  With warmest greetings,</p>

<p n="1">On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with deepest thanks the
receipt of your letter of the 17th October, and wish also to thank your
Assembly for forwarding to him the photostatic reproduction of the
registration certificate of the Assembly of Auckland.  He fervently hopes
that the formation of the Declaration of Trust of the NSA will also be
completed very soon, and that the difficulty you have encountered in this
connection will be satisfactorily met and settled.  He also trusts that the
delay caused in registering the Sydney Local Assembly will be overcome,
and that you will immediately proceed with the formation of your National
Declaration of Trust.  It is splendid, and a matter of deepest satisfaction to
our beloved Guardian that in all these steps you are taking for the
administrative development and consolidation of the Faith in Australia and
New Zealand you are closely and faithfully following the example of America
which, it should be admitted, occupies a pre-eminent rank among its sister
communities in both the East and the West.</p>

<p n="2">As regards the problem facing the N.S.A. in connection with the
representation of Perth at the next Annual Convention; the Guardian
believes that the fact that a certain Assembly or community is not in a
financial position to defray the expenses of its delegate or delegates does
not constitute sufficient justification for depriving it from its sacred right of
participation in the national elections and other activities of the Convention.
Every Assembly, no matter how poor, is entitled to take part in the
Convention proceedings by sending one or more delegates to that meeting.
It is absolutely essential that this principle be clearly understood and faithfully
applied by the friends.  Financial considerations can under no circumstances
invalidate it, or allow the least compromise in its application.  It is the duty
of every N.S.A. to ensure that it will be carried out whenever the Convention
elections are held.</p>

<p n="1">The Guardian has received your message of last April, &amp; his heart has
been most profoundly touched by the sentiments of love, loyalty and devotion
you had been moved to convey to him on the occasion of his marriage.  He
highly prizes indeed your words, &amp; deeply appreciates the assurances you

Australia &amp; New Zealand, and cherishes the highest hopes for the future of
that Community.  Though your numbers are yet small and your material
resources restricted, you should nevertheless rejoice at the realization that
the Cause in these far-off lands has at last been firmly and permanently
established, that with the passing of every year, nay of every month, some
definite progress is achieved, and that despite the forces of opposition, both
from within &amp; outside it, your community is forging ahead, slowly but
steadily, confident in the divine confirmations &amp; guidance of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian is particularly rejoiced at the news of the formation of
the first Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer School at Yerrinbool--which step is a
clear evidence that your community is alive &amp; is progressing quite
satisfactorily.  He would urge the friends, each &amp; all, to help by every means
in their power, to further the interests of that institution which, if maintained
&amp; developed, can be of invaluable teaching help to the Cause.</p>

<p n="1">Your welcome communication of June 30th written on behalf of the

<p n="2">How rejoiced he feels to witness the increasing evidences of the growing
progress of the community of the Australian and New Zealand believers.
The considerable work that they have accomplished during the last few
years, in both the teaching and the administrative fields, could not indeed
have been carried out without the wise and effective leadership of your
N.S.A. who, ever since its inception, has been functioning with a loyalty
and efficiency that are truly remarkable.</p>

<p n="3">The success of this year's convention, as evidenced by the report of the
proceedings you had sent, marks a further step in the process of steady
consolidation through which the N.S.A. is passing, and indicates how strong
are the loyalty and attachment which it has awakened among the body of
the believers throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p n="4">It is the Guardian's fervent hope that this confidence which your
Assembly has inspired will be further strengthened during the course of this
year, and that this in turn will deepen in the members the sense of the
heavy responsibility they have to shoulder for the extension and
consolidation of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> work throughout that continent.</p>

that a ballot paper should contain necessarily nine votes.  The individual

<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> friend,</salute>

<p n="1">I am directed by our beloved Guardian to convey his thanks to you for
your letter of the 13th instant and to express his profound and loving
appreciation of the contribution you have enclosed in the name of the
National Assembly of Australia and New Zealand toward the International
Fund of the Cause.  I am sending herewith a separate receipt duly signed by
him for your files.  The spirit of true sacrifice and devotion which this offering
represents is indeed a source of deepest satisfaction to the Guardian and he
will certainly pray that, as the years go by, it may increasingly gain in strength,
and become so intensified as to enable the believers throughout Australia
and New Zealand to accomplish such deeds of service as would make them
<pb n="137"/>the object of the admiration and envy of all their sister communities in
both Europe and America.  Already the signs of tremendous vitality which
the Australian and New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community is evincing are
sufficiently numerous to justify such high hopes, and augur well for the
glorious future it is destined to have.  The news of the safe arrival of Miss
Dawe to Australia and of the inspiration the friends have gained through
sharing the impressions of her memorable pilgrimage to the Holy Land is
yet another source of deep gratification to the Guardian.  He fervently hopes
that the way may be opened for most of our Australian and New Zealand
friends to visit the Holy Shrines in the not distant future.</p>

<p n="1">I am directed by our beloved Guardian to express his loving thanks for
the message of sympathy, dated May 15th, which you had written him on
behalf of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Perth, conveying your condolences on the occasion

the thought that she has at last been liberated from the sufferings &amp;

How happy she must be now in this eternal reunion with her loved ones,

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>

<p n="1">I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to express his thanks for your
communication of May 14th, with the enclosed copy of the resolutions passed
by the Australian and New Zealand N.S.A. in its April meeting held in
Melbourne.  He has also noted with deep satisfaction the program of the
public meetings you had arranged on that occasion, and is very much
heartened to know that the response from the public has been most genuine
and quite beyond your expectations.</p>

<p n="2">The general situation of the Cause in Melbourne, however, has caused
immense grief to his heart, specially as the believers themselves are losing
<pb n="139"/>interest and seem to be drifting away.  The decision taken by your Assembly
to hold the next Annual Convention there, with the view of encouraging
and guiding the friends to reorganise their activities, and also in order to
stimulate the progress of the teaching work in that centre is most splendid.
The Guardian would strongly advise that in the meantime every effort be
exerted, through such means as the N.S.A. may find feasible and effective,
to bring back into the community those members who have already left,
and to take immediate measures to discourage those who contemplate doing
so.</p>

<p n="3">With reference to Miss Martha Root's projected teaching trip to your
shores; the Guardian highly appreciates the cordial invitation extended to
her by your Assembly, and has every hope that through her splendid zeal,
mature and wide experience in the teaching field, she will be able to lend
an unprecedented impetus to the expansion and consolidation of the
teaching work throughout Australia and New Zealand during this coming
winter.</p>

<p n="4">In closing I wish to convey through you to the newly-elected N.S.A.
the Guardian's heartfelt congratulations and sincere greetings and to assure
them of his prayers, that throughout their new term of office, they may be
assisted in acquitting themselves befittingly of their task.</p>

<p n="5">Also kindly extend to them his loving thanks for the expression of
deep sympathy which they have conveyed to him on their behalf and in the
name of the believers in New Zealand and Australia in the passing away of
the Holy Mother, <w type="dw">Munirih</w> <w type="dw">Khanum</w>.</p>

spirit which the believers themselves manifest, the support they extend to them, the
vigilance, steadfastness, and self-sacrifice that distinguish the record of their services.
The foundations they are laying will endure and broaden as the days go by, and
the institutions they are erecting will multiply a thousandfold if they persevere in
the path they are now treading.  The blessings of the <w type="dw">Abha</w> Beauty will enable

<p n="1"><pb n="140"/>I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge with thanks your
Assembly's communication of October 6th.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding the need you have expressed for a small, inexpensive prayer
book for use by the friends in Australia and New Zealand; he views with
favour the idea, but does not advise the use of the translations given in the

He wishes you to preferably select from the book <bibl><title>Prayers and Meditations</title>,

<p n="3">The Guardian wishes me to express his gratification at the news of the
enrolment of three new members in the Sydney <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> group, and of two
others in the Auckland community.  He will pray that these new believers
may continue deepening in their faith, and in their understanding of the
Teachings, and that each of them may arise and lend every assistance in his
power to the further expansion and firmer consolidation of the Faith in that
far-off continent.</p>

<p n="4">The three reproductions of the Sydney Registration Certificate which
you have mailed under separate cover have been duly received, and one of
them will shortly be placed in the Mansion at <w type="dw">Bahji</w>.</p>

<p n="5">The projected visit of Miss Martha Root to your shores next winter,
the Guardian hopes, will as on her previous journeys serve to impart a fresh
stimulus to the friends in Australia and New Zealand and inspire them with
a renewed determination to re-consecrate themselves to the service of the
Cause.  Your Assembly should extend to her a warm welcome and every
support she requires for the success of her mission.  May her noble endeavours,
seconded by the energetic and diligent efforts of the believers, result in
inaugurating a new era of teaching expansion throughout the Australian

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>

<p n="1">Your very cordial message of the 27th November addressed to our
beloved Guardian has duly reached him, and he has noted with keen
appreciation indeed the desire you had expressed of visiting the Holy Shrines
on your way back to New Zealand.</p>

<p n="2">As you must have surely read in the newspapers however the general
situation in Palestine is at present so gravely disturbed as to make it quite
impossible for you to undertake this trip in the next few months, and in
view of this the Guardian would advise that you postpone your visit until
the November of next year, by which time, it is hoped, the situation
throughout the country will have sufficiently improved to permit you to
undertake this long-cherished pilgrimage.  The Guardian, needless to say,
would be also most delighted to meet you, &amp; to hear from you directly of
the news of the Cause in New Zealand, &amp; to discuss certain matters which
the N.S.A. has asked you to present to him for his instructions.</p>

<p n="3">Regarding your question whether there is any special ceremony which
the believers should perform when they wish to "name" a baby; the teachings
do not provide for any ceremony whatever on such occasions.  We have no
"baptismal service" in the Cause, such as the Christians have.  There would
be no objection, however, for the friends to come together on such happy
occasions, provided they do not hold an official public ceremony, &amp; provided
also they strictly avoid uniformity and rigidity in all such practices.  No rule
whatsoever that would tend to be rigid and uniform should be allowed in
such secondary matters, particularly as there are no specific instructions in
the Teachings regarding them.</p>

that in spite of the serious handicaps under which you are labouring, your
Community is steadily forging ahead, and is increasing in numbers &amp; growing

much circumscribed in view of your limited numbers and resources, you
should not feel discouraged, but look at the years ahead with absolute, nay
ever-deepening confidence, &amp; indomitable courage.</p>

<p n="2">Martha's visit, the Guardian hopes, will prove once more the signal for
a further intensification of your teaching activities, and he is eagerly awaiting

Continent.  He is confident that the friends will spare no effort to make her
journey pleasant &amp; successful, &amp; will avail themselves of the opportunity of
her presence in their midst to extend the scope &amp; consolidate the foundations
of their teaching work.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian was most deeply interested &amp; pleased to read Miss Dawe's
letter addressed to you &amp; Father Dunn on her way back from the Holy Land
last winter.  He is glad to know how much this visit to the Holy Shrines has

<p n="3">Now that your India itinerary has drawn to a happy and successful

Burma.</p>

<p n="1">Your deeply appreciated letters of the 1st and 6th January have been

<p n="2">He was deeply touched and rejoiced to know of the farewell meetings
which the friends had arranged on the occasion of your sailing from Bombay,
and to realize the profound effect which your historic visit to India had left
on the hearts of every one of the believers.  This high position which you
have come to occupy in their affections is certainly well deserved and rightly
won.  For the seeds you have so ably and devotedly planted in almost every
important part of that country, during this one year of ceaseless and intense
teaching work, constitute a record of service of unparalleled magnitude in
the history of the Faith in that land.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian hopes you will one day be able to re-visit India, and
witness the rich harvest which your untiring efforts have brought forth.  For
the present, he would advise that, soon after the termination of your teaching
tour throughout Australia and New Zealand this coming June, you should
return to the United States, and extend your stay there, and later on visit
Central and South America, and assist in extending the teaching campaign
in these Central and South American Republics, where the Teaching work
is fast beginning to develop and advance.  The opening up of these Latin
American countries, as you undoubtedly know, constitute one of the chief
and most difficult objectives of the Seven-Year Plan.  Your invaluable co-operation
in this Inter-American campaign of teaching would therefore be
received with universal welcome by the believers, and will greatly encourage
and stimulate them to carry this heavy task to successful completion.</p>

<p n="4">Regarding your suggestion for the establishment of a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> School in
Karachi, the Guardian would advise that whenever you find a favourable
opportunity to approach the American believers regarding this matter you
should do so, without, however, bringing any pressure to bear upon them to
contribute the funds required for the erection of such an Institution.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian was deeply grieved to hear of the heavy losses inflicted

<pb n="145"/>during the recent riots in Mandalay.  He wishes you to convey to him his
sympathy, as well as his approval of his wish to sell part of the shops, in view
of his strained material conditions which render such step most necessary
indeed.</p>

<p n="6">The Guardian has noted with deep gratitude the love and assistance
which Mr. F. has so kindly extended to you during your stay in Calcutta, and
wishes you to convey to him his thanks and his high sense of admiration for
his valuable and deeply appreciated services.</p>

<p n="1">Your communication of February the 12th addressed to our beloved
Guardian, informing him of Martha's safe arrival in Australia, has been
received, &amp; he was made truly happy to know how cordially &amp; befittingly
she had been welcomed by the friends.  The wide acclamation with which
you have greeted her upon her arrival, and the kind solicitude &amp; warm
affection you have displayed towards her by arranging for dear Dr. Bolton to
give her the necessary treatment soon after her landing in Adelaide--such
spontaneous expressions of your deep set admiration &amp; love for this valiant
and indefatigable star-servant of the Cause must have surely greatly warmed
and touched her heart.</p>

<p n="2">Your N.S.A., no less than the Local Assemblies of Perth &amp; Adelaide,
has undoubtedly spared no effort to use her presence as an opportunity for
giving the Faith every publicity possible through both the radio &amp; the press.
It is to be hoped that before long the results of this campaign of publicity
will be made apparent, &amp; a good number of sincere &amp; intelligent inquirers
will be led to investigate and seriously study the Teachings, &amp; enrol later on
in the Community.</p>

<p n="3">While the Guardian wishes the friends to take full advantage of Martha's
<pb n="148"/>presence &amp; invite her to speak and teach as frequently as her energies permit,
yet he would advise that they should also take great care lest her health be
seriously impaired through overwork, specially as she is already so frail, having
extensively travelled &amp; tirelessly laboured for a whole year throughout India.
He would further entreat the believers to join him in ardently supplicating
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to continue bestowing upon our well-beloved &amp; distinguished
sister all the strength &amp; energy that she requires for the continuation and
successful termination of her teaching tour throughout Australia &amp; New
Zealand.</p>

<p n="4">With reference to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bolton's request for permission to visit
Haifa during next October or November, the Guardian wishes to assure
them that they would be most welcome to undertake this pilgrimage through
which, he hopes, they will get refreshed spiritually &amp; filled with renewed
vigour and added determination to labour for the further promotion of the
Faith upon their return home.  With the season's best greetings to you and

<salute>Dear Miss Root,</salute>

<p n="1">The Guardian has received and read with deepest pleasure your letters
dated February 11th and 26th with the many enclosures, and feels
inexpressibly happy to know of the very cordial and befitting welcome
extended to you by the friends upon your arrival in Australia, and of the
many opportunities you have had of contacting leading figures in the various
towns you have visited.  The many messages you were able to broadcast,
particularly that on Tahirih, which was so warmly received and appreciated
by the Director of Broadcasting of all South Australia, surely cannot fail to
awaken interest in the Cause, and might even lead many listeners to seriously
investigate and study the teachings, and possibly later on apply for full
<pb n="149"/>membership in the community.  Anyhow, you have certainly spared no effort
to sow the seeds, and time alone will prove how fertile has been the soil on
which they have fallen.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding Queen Marie's Will, which is reported to contain references
to the Cause, the Guardian has received no information whatever to such
effect, but has, following your letter, written both Miss Jack and Mrs Lynch,
and asked them to secure, by whatever means possible, copies of the
Bucharest paper which is stated to contain the references in question.  He
has neither received any communication from the Queen, and would
therefore wish you to carefully ascertain the truth of the reports, and let
him know of any information you receive, as soon as possible.</p>

<p n="3">Concerning your teaching itinerary; the Guardian wishes me to stress
again the necessity of you avoiding excessive work and of safeguarding your
health, and also of adhering to your plan, which he has already approved, to
return to the United States in time for the Geyserville Summer-School,
and to spend the winter in the southern states, or preferably, if possible, in
Central America where the teaching work is not making steady progress,
and is in need of any support it can receive from visiting <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="4">In view of the urgency, and increasing requirements of the teaching
program set forth by the Seven-Year Plan, the Guardian would advise that
on your return to the States next June you should devote all your energies
to the nation-wide and unprecedented campaign of teaching activity, which
is now gradually extending all over the American Continent from Alaska
to the North, down to the Republic of Chile in the South, putting at the
service of this Inter-American teaching campaign all those talents and
qualities which you have acquired during your many years of experience in
the field of pioneer teaching.</p>

from England, &amp; your inability to defer your visit to Haifa till next November.
He regrets indeed that you should find it impossible to extend your stay in
Europe and come to Palestine in autumn, as the situation here is now so
tense &amp; dangerous that there seems very little hope of any real amelioration
in security conditions to take place by next May.  General conditions
throughout the country are, at present, even worse than a month ago, &amp;

<p n="1">Your sweet &amp; most assuring message of the 2nd February has duly
reached our beloved Guardian, and his heart was inexpressibly gladdened
by its perusal, &amp; at the joyful tidings of the slow yet steady progress of the
Cause in Sydney &amp; in the rest of Australia.  How happy &amp; grateful indeed
you must feel to have lived until this day, &amp; to have witnessed the glorious
harvest which, after many years of tireless &amp; painstaking effort, it has been
your reward and your incomparable privilege to gather &amp; offer to the Faith
in such a remote yet so highly-promising Continent.  Although, in view of
your advanced age &amp; its attending ailments and disabilities, you feel no
longer able to take as active a share as you wish in the activities of the
Cause, yet your very presence is, in itself, such a valuable asset to the
Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community as will surely compensate for any particular
act of service, however meritorious, which you may be able to render, whether
in the teaching or the administrative fields of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activity.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian, therefore, would urge you above all to preserve your
health, &amp; to avoid any activity that might prove too strenuous &amp; fatiguing,
even though this may necessitate a considerable curtailment in your general
work for the Cause.</p>

<p n="3">He keenly &amp; lovingly appreciates the care &amp; consideration you have
been shown by the believers in this respect, &amp; feels particularly grateful to
Mr Rupert Hearne<note n="49" type="foot">Rupert Hearne, a Chemist in Bathurst, N.S.W., was among Hyde Dunn's friends
and business acquaintances.  He was not a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>.</note> and other friends who have proved so helpful to you
during your illness.  He will surely remember them all in his prayers,
entreating the Beloved to abundantly reward them for their services &amp; to
ever strengthen &amp; guide their forces in service to His Cause.</p>

<p n="4">Concerning your question regarding the identity of Abraham and
Zoroaster; in the light of a statement from <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, in which he says
that Zoroaster came to Palestine &amp; met the Hebrew prophets, one can rightly
infer that Zoroaster was a different historical person than Abraham, and
that the two, therefore, were not identical.</p>

<lb/>
Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bolton,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1"><pb n="158"/>Your loving messages of the 30th September have safely arrived, and
their contents noted with feelings of deepest gratitude by our beloved
Guardian.  He too, indeed, profoundly regrets that circumstances should have
prevented you from carrying out your hearts' earnest and long-cherished
desire of visiting the Holy Shrines, and can profoundly realize how utterly
disappointed you both feel over such a privation.  But it is assuredly a comfort
to know that your extensive trip throughout the United States and Canada
has been of such deep spiritual experience to you, and has also proved to be
of such inspiration and encouragement to the friends in these countries as
cannot but compensate, in however small a measure, for the sorrows and
disappointment you now feel at having been unable to visit the Holy Land.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian nevertheless hopes and indeed will fervently pray that
you may one day be given the opportunity of undertaking this pilgrimage,
and thus fulfil this dear wish of your hearts.</p>

<p n="3">With the renewed expression of his best wishes, and the assurances of
his prayers for your welfare and protection, and the steady extension of the
field of your services to the Faith in Australia.</p>

the Sacred Threshold, and, will supplicate for you the richest blessings and the
unfailing protection and guidance of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in your incessant, your valued

<p n="1">I would have answered your welcome letter before but shortly before
receiving it the news came that my beloved Mother had passed away
unexpectedly in Buenos Aires.  This was, as you can well imagine, a most
heavy blow to hear!</p>

<p n="2">She had gone there to teach our beloved Faith, but as she was over
seventy and had very frail health, it seems to have proved too much of an
exertion for her--she died of heart failure three days after her arrival!</p>

<p n="3">The love and kindness of the Guardian has been my mainstay and
support and the wonderful things he has said of Mother have helped assuage
the wound.</p>

<p n="4">She died as I hope all of us will, serving this beloved Cause up to the
<pb n="160"/>last minute--giving all for it.  Like our dear Martha Root!  We have wonderful
souls who have shown us the way, all we have to do is pray for strength to

<p n="1">The Guardian wishes me to express his deep regret at this tardy

<p n="2">The cheque for five pounds which you had enclosed representing the

confidently hopes that your Assembly, with the help and support of all the
believers in that land, will continue prosecuting, with the same devoted
zeal, resourcefulness and determination as before, its twofold task of
extending the scope of the teaching work, and of the further consolidating
the foundations of the Administration.  The unity and efficiency with which

the Guardian's fervent hope that, notwithstanding the delay and dislocation
which the prosecution of the war has inevitably occasioned, it will continue

<p n="1">At the Guardian's direction I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
communication of December 17th just arrived, together with the copy of
the resolutions passed by the NSA of Australia and New Zealand in its
August meeting, as well as the copy of the statement on the <bibl><title><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Attitude
to War</title></bibl> recently issued by your Assembly.  He found that statement most
satisfactory both in its form and in its clear and comprehensive presentation
of the underlying principles governing the collective attitude of the believers
in this vital issue of the hour.</p>

<p n="2">The friends should indeed make a careful study of this statement, so as
to be able to intelligently and correctly answer any questions put to them
either by the authorities or individual enquirers.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian has been particularly pleased to note that the response
of the Prime Minister, and of the Premier of Victoria and other ministers to
whom you had submitted a copy of the above statement has been so cordial,
and he feels relieved to know that through this action of your Assembly any
doubts or misapprehensions regarding the attitude of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> to war
have been dispelled, and that the authorities feel, as a result, much more
favourable towards the Cause, now that they know for themselves that it is
certainly non-political in character and that it enjoins absolute loyalty and
obedience to the Government.</p>

<p n="4">This opportunity your Assembly has had of establishing direct contact
with the authorities is indeed a step of vital significance to the Cause in
Australia and New Zealand, and is bound to pave the way for its ultimate
recognition as an independent religious Faith, entitled to the same rights
and privileges which other religious bodies and institutions enjoy in that
land.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian wishes me in closing to express his deepfelt appreciation
of your teaching services in Melbourne and Hobart, in which cities you
seem to have accomplished such splendid work, both in introducing the
Cause to the general public and by assisting the friends in better conducting
<pb n="163"/>their teaching and administrative activities.</p>

<p n="6">May the Beloved ever bless and guide your efforts, and may He also

Australia's Regional Teaching Committee.  In 1945 he was elected to the
National Assembly.  When the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Adelaide city formed Assemblies at
municipal level he became part of the Unley community, being its delegate to
National Convention.  He was on Unley Assembly when it was incorporated in
1962.</note> will be

<p n="3">The wonderful spirit of intelligent devotion and steadfastness which
animates the Australian, as well as the New Zealand, <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in these difficult
days, is of great comfort to Shoghi Effendi and a source of pride and
satisfaction to him in his ceaseless labours for the Faith.</p>

<p n="4">He was grieved at the news of the passing of beloved Father Dunn--a
man whose name and deeds will never be forgotten.  He, as well as Mother
Dunn, are like abundant bearing trees.  They have given spiritual life to a
whole continent, and now one of them has gone to reap his rich reward in
the <w type="dw">Abha</w> Kingdom.  He feels sure that the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> are doing everything in

the greatest gift in the world--the knowledge of the Promise of all Ages!</p>

felt impelled to have the <bibl><publisher>American N.S.A.</publisher></bibl> publish it in <bibl><title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> News</title></bibl> and
also have it read at the annual Convention.  He feels that in excellent form
you have presented the very essence of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> attitude on these matters.
This has further strengthened his conviction that the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia
and New Zealand display a remarkable soundness in their views on all matters
concerning the Faith, a characteristic which greatly pleases him.</p>

<p n="5">Concerning your question whether a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Burial Service can be
<pb n="168"/>conducted for <w type="dw">non-Baha'is</w> if requested by them; if <w type="dw">non-Baha'is</w> desire that
the believers should conduct a service there is no objection at all.</p>

<p n="6">The contemplated teaching trip of Miss Brooks, Mrs Hawthorne and
Mrs Moffitt<note n="60" type="foot">Charlotte Moffitt (d. 1950) became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in Adelaide in 1923, and was
correspondence secretary of the first Adelaide Assembly, established in
December.  She lived for periods in England between 1925 and 1936.  Martha
Root stayed with her in London for a month in 1925.  Mrs. Moffitt was a member
of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New

the Sydney Local Assembly from 1932 until 1935.  In the 1940s she travelled to
Hobart, Melbourne and Brisbane together with Hilda Brooks and Jane Routh,
and moved to Melbourne in November 1945 to assist with teaching in the
Victorian capital, returning to Sydney two years later.  She died 21 November
1950.</note> to Queensland, meets with the Guardian's whole-hearted
approval.  He will pray in the Holy Shrines that its outcome will be richly
blessed and fruitful.</p>

<p n="7">He was very sorry to learn that Miss Stevenson has passed on.  He will

<p n="1">The Guardian has instructed me to answer your welcome letter to him
of June 20th, with all its good news.</p>

<p n="2">The response your teaching work met with in Brisbane is truly most
encouraging and shows a remarkable receptivity on the part of the people of
Australia to the Divine Message.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will be
able to undertake many such trips in furtherance of the teaching work and
that an increasing number of the friends will do likewise.</p>

<p n="3">Indeed all the news that comes from the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New
Zealand bears witness to the soundness of their understanding of the
teachings, their loyalty and devotion to the Cause and its laws, and the
excellence of their faith itself.</p>

of the West.<note n="61" type="foot"><bibl><title>The Promised Day is Come</title>, <date>March 28, 1941</date></bibl>.</note>  Owing to its length and the difficulty of sending a large
number of manuscripts abroad at such a time, he has requested the N.S.A.
of America to forward it to the other National Spiritual Assemblies.  He
trusts it will soon reach you.</p>

<p n="5">The news received of the Winter session of the Yerrinbool school was
very encouraging.</p>

<p n="6">Shoghi Effendi hopes that many of these points of community contact, such
as school sessions, teaching conferences--whatever form of activity is most
feasible--will be increasingly inaugurated, as they are of vital importance in
<pb n="170"/>fostering the work of the Cause.</p>

<p n="7">He most deeply appreciates your own untiring services in promotion of
the Faith in all its branches.  You may rest assured that he will often pray for
you, and he will also pray for the confirmation of those souls whom you and
Mrs. Hawthorne attracted during your recent trip.</p>

It is indeed thrilling to note the rapidity and soundness with which the flourishing

fearlessly proclaiming its truths, upholding its verities and standards, multiplying
its institutions, defending its interests, disseminating its literature, and exemplifying
its invincible power and spirit.  I rejoice, feel proud and am eternally grateful.  I
cannot but pray, with redoubled fervour, to Him Who so manifestly guides and
sustains you, to increase your numbers, to remove every barrier that obstructs
your path, to safeguard your unity, to bless your undertakings and to enable you
to demonstrate, afresh and with still greater force, the reality of the faith that
animates you in the discharge of your sacred duties.

<p n="2">He was delighted to hear of the increased work of the Yerrinbool School

<p n="3">He was also most happy to learn that, through the spirit disseminated
by the school, a group of souls in Yerrinbool have joined the Faith.  No
better testimony to the value of these institutions could be asked for!  He
hopes that the Adelaide Winter School Session will prove also a great success,
<pb n="171"/>and that believers in other centers of Australia and New Zealand will find it
possible to inaugurate some similar activity, as the distances are so great in
those countries that not many of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> can afford at present to gather
in one spot.</p>

the believers are only just beginning to grasp and practice it properly.  So we

<p n="2">He was delighted with the excellent news you gave him of the progress
of the work in Tasmania.  In fact previous to receiving your letter he had
heard glowing reports, from some of the Australian friends, of the progress
the Cause is making there, and thus feels already somewhat familiar with
your work.</p>

<p n="3">You did quite right to write him, and he hopes from time to time you
will inform him of the progress of your activities in which he takes the
keenest interest.</p>

<p n="4">It is impossible for the friends like yourselves, labouring to establish
the Faith in a new and distant territory, to grasp the significance of your
achievements.  But those who come after you, and find the foundation laid,
the pioneering done, and the harvest ready to be reaped, will know how to
befittingly value your labours and appreciate your devotion.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian was delighted to hear of your youth group.  The children
who are trained in the world-embracing teachings of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> cannot
but grow up to be a truly new race of men.  He hopes these young people
will prepare themselves for the great task which will face them in the future,
that of helping to re-build the world with the aid and inspiration of the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings.</p>

<p n="6">He assures you all that he will ardently pray in the Holy Shrines for the
<pb n="178"/>progress of your work, and that you may speedily establish a Spiritual
Assembly there.</p>

<p n="7">The wonderful help Dr. and Mrs Bolton have given you, he greatly
appreciates.  They are truly exemplary servants of their fellow-men.</p>

<p n="8">Assuring you of his most loving thoughts and wishes for your welfare
and protection.</p>

<p n="1">The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated Sep. 23rd.
and Oct. 1st, and to acknowledge the receipt of the manuscript you sent for
<bibl><title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World</title> <biblScope type="Volume">vol IX</biblScope></bibl>, also the photographs of Father Dunn's home and his
<pb n="179"/>own picture.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding the questions you asked in your letter...</p>

<p n="3"><emph rend="underscore">No. 1.</emph> Confucius was not a Prophet, so it is quite correct to say he is the founder of a moral system and a great reformer.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 2.</emph> The Buddha was a Manifestation of God, like Christ, but his followers do not possess his authentic writings.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 3.</emph> Zoroaster was not Abraham; the Muslims, some of them, contend that they were the same, but we believe they were two distinct Prophets.  There is a misunderstanding in the reference in <bibl><title><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Proofs</title></bibl> to this matter.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 4.</emph> There are no Prophets, so far, in the same category as <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, as
He culminates a great cycle with Adam.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 5.</emph> The Greatest Name is the Name of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  "<w type="dw">Ya </w> <w type="dw">Baha'u'l-Abha</w>" is an invocation meaning "O Thou Glory of Glories"!  Both refer to
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.  By Greatest Name is meant that <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> has appeared in God's Greatest Name, in other words, that He is the supreme manifestation of God.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 6.</emph> <bibl><title>Revelations</title> <biblScope type="chapter-verse">3:12</biblScope></bibl>, refers to the Revelation of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 7.</emph> References in the <bibl><title>Bible</title></bibl> to "Mt Paran" and "Paraclete" refer to

<emph rend="underscore">No. 8.</emph> The statement in the <bibl><title>Gleanings</title>, <biblScope type="Page">p. 64 -- 65</biblScope></bibl>, "who out of utter nothingness..." etc., should be taken in a symbolic and not literal sense.  It is only to demonstrate the power and greatness of God.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 9.</emph> The Guardian considers that the gist of what Mrs Hanford Ford reported can be considered quite correct.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 10.</emph> The figures 1290 date from the declaration of Muhammad, ten years
before His flight to Medina.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 11.</emph> The intercalary days are specially set aside for hospitality, the giving
of gifts, etc.  <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> Himself specified that they be used in this way, but
gave no explanation for it.
<emph rend="underscore">No. 12.</emph> The <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer Schools were originated in America to meet
the requirements of the friends.  They have been adopted by other <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities the world-over, but there is no reason why they should be
called "Summer Schools".  There is nothing rigid about the term, it is purely
descriptive.  The Guardian feels that although you can have the immediate
affairs of your Summer-Schools managed by a convenient Local Assembly,
they should remain under the direct supervision of the National Spiritual
Assembly as they are national in character and not purely local.</p>

<p n="4">A few days ago Mr Jim Heggie came to see the Guardian.  He was able
<pb n="180"/>to visit all the Shrines and archives as well.  Shoghi Effendi was delighted
with him; he found him devoted, full of faith and zeal, and very well read in
the teachings.  He feels that if this is a sample of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> youth of Australia,
there is, indeed, a wonderful future ahead of that country!</p>

<p n="5">He will be very pleased to receive the picture of Father Dunn's grave as
soon as it is available.</p>

<p n="6">The Guardian assures you and the members of the National Spiritual
Assembly that his prayers are constantly being offered on your behalf.  He is
so very pleased with the good news he receives of your activities and the
spread of the Cause in those distant lands.</p>

<p n="7">Only yesterday he was reading a most heartening and enthusiastic report
of the work in Tasmania, which greatly cheered him.</p>

<p n="8">Dark as these days are he feels confident that the Australian and New
Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> will continue with unabated devotion to carry on their
excellent and exemplary services to the Faith.</p>

<p n="9">His prayers are with them all, and his loving gratitude goes out to you
who lead and co-ordinate their activities.</p>

<p n="2">He hopes that your brother will again be able to visit Haifa, while he is

<p n="3">Recently, two Australian believers, serving with the army, have been
able to visit Haifa, one from Adelaide and one from Sydney.  The Guardian
was so happy to meet these friends, as the distance is so great between
Australia and the Holy Land that few of your members are ever able to

ever so devotedly accomplishing in your service to the Faith.</p>

<p n="5">Though the present outlook seems dark indeed, we must think of the

which the Founders of our Faith have promised us lies ahead of the entire

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>

<p n="1">Your letter, with enclosures of Nov 8th reached the Guardian safely,
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">His thoughts and prayers are very often with the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in
these difficult and dangerous times.  They are now facing a much more acute
situation than hitherto.  But whatever of trial and affliction the immediate
future may hold for them, we know that the destiny of mankind is in the
firm grasp of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and that he will guide it to its ultimate and highest
goal.  This assurance is more precious than life itself, it is our anchor in
every difficulty and trial.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian was very happy to know that the work in Brisbane is
progressing, and that the Cause is more and more coming before the public
and reaching the attention of prominent people.</p>

<p n="4">He feels the believers must continue to do their utmost to acquaint
their fellow-citizens with the teachings, that they may at least hear of the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> ideals, whether they are ready to accept them yet or not.</p>

<p n="5">The recent meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly must have been
of great benefit to all the members and to the work of the Cause in general.
Their responsibility in these days is greater than ever, but Shoghi Effendi
feels sure they will be guided and protected and continue to spread and safe-guard
<pb n="183"/>the Faith in those distant lands.</p>

<p n="6">He assures you, and all the N.S.A. members, of his deep appreciation
for your untiring services and his loving and ardent prayers.  He will beseech
for you all blessings and protection in the Holy Shrines.</p>

have performed and will continue to perform in the future.  Adversity, in whatever
form, will, I feel confident, now that they have laid an unassailable basis for the
Faith, in their hearts and through their institutions, serve to heighten the ardour of
their devotion and reinforce the foundation of their spiritual community life.  They
should persevere, redouble their efforts, close their ranks, intensify their individual
as well as collective teaching activities, and defend even more tenaciously and
courageously the tenets, claims and institutions of their Faith.  Measureless blessings
will crown their exertions if they persevere and face heroically the challenge, the
problems and the perplexities of the present hour.

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The Guardian has instructed me to answer your two letters of Jan. 15th
and 24th, and to acknowledge the receipt of the enclosed letter of Mrs.
Dunn.</p>

<p n="2">He was delighted to learn that the New Zealand members were able to
make the trip to Australia, and that such a highly satisfactory N.S.A. meeting
was held, in such a spirit of love and harmony.  No doubt this experience
will prove of great value, not only to the National Assembly, but also to the
work of the Cause in the days to come.</p>

<p n="3">Regarding the various matters you refer to in your letters: The Guardian
highly approves of the very kind and helpful arrangements made by Dr.
Bolton, by which his property at Yerrinbool will pass to the Faith at his
death and be used, according to the requirements of a future date, as dictated
by the discretion of the N.S.A.  It is better that the believers, subject to the
judgements of the N.S.A., be left free to select any spot that will prove most
convenient for the majority for the summer-schools.</p>

<p n="4">Regarding the Summer-Schools in general; although there is no
objection to their being under the direct management of a special committee
elected for that purpose, they must be generally supervised by the N.S.A. in
respect to policy, etc.  In other words they must be considered as a national
and not a purely local institution.</p>

<p n="5">For purposes of convenience the N.S.A. may appoint as members of
such Committees, those who are situated near the Summer-Schools and are
able to pay direct attention to their affairs.</p>

<p n="6">Concerning individual <w type="dw">Baha'is'</w> letters to the Guardian and his replies;
<pb n="185"/>the friends are free to write to the Guardian when they feel the urge to do
so.  However, for the believers to suppose that the Guardian's letters to them,
however full of loving encouragement they may be, give them any special
powers or authority to go against or ignore the wishes of their Local or
National Assembly, is to grossly misinterpret his true meaning.  The Guardian
has been at great pains to build up the administrative order and teach the
friends how to use it.  How could he possibly himself act in such a way as to
ignore or belittle the functions of these bodies?  He often encourages believers
to work, to teach, to pursue some plan they propose in their letters to him
but this does not mean a veto of the Assembly's rights, or that the individual
thus becomes free to ignore its authority.  He trusts this will make the matter
quite plain to the friends.</p>

<p n="7">Regarding the matter of Mother Dunn's letter; the N.S.A., will, he
feels sure, do all in their power to allay the fears of Mother Dunn and smooth
out any misunderstandings that may arise.  He feels, however, that you should
point out to Mother Dunn that if, at any future date, the believers of Australia
and New Zealand should wish to remove the remains of Father Dunn and
herself to a beautiful site in a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> cemetery, or any other chosen spot,
they cannot do it without some legal authorization.  Just at present, after an
infinite amount of red tape being gotten through, the Egyptian N.S.A. has
at last succeeded in getting arrangements made for the transfer of Lua
Getsinger's and <w type="dw">Mirza</w> <w type="dw">Abu'l-Fadl's</w> bodies to the new <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Cemetery.  It is
to ensure success and save trouble in the future, that your Assembly is asking
her to delegate certain powers to it in this matter.  He feels sure she will
cooperate fully when she understands the matter.</p>

<p n="8">In view of the criticalness of the times, the great issues facing the entire
human race, and the uncertainty of what perils and trials may yet remain
ahead of us to be endured, the Guardian feels that the sooner Father Dunn's
memorial is erected the better.  Mother Dunn may rest assured in her heart
that future believers of Australia will know how to honour and cherish dear
Father Dunn's grave; for the time being, though, it seems to him it would be
wise to complete whatever arrangements are under way as speedily as possible,
subject, of course, to her acceptance, as he does not want her to be distressed
or unhappy over this matter.</p>

<p n="9">The Guardian would be very glad to receive as soon as possible
photographs of Father Dunn's grave upon its completion, to be placed in
the Mansion of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> at <w type="dw">Bahji</w>.</p>

<p n="10">He assures you all that he feels the greatest confidence in your ability
to aid the believers of Australia and New Zealand to weather all storms
during the dark days we are passing through.  The friends of those two
countries have amply displayed their deep loyalty to the Faith, their profound
<pb n="186"/>dedication to its Divine Mission, their adherence to its laws and institutions.
He always thinks of them with a heart at rest and feelings of deep affection.</p>

<p n="11">Rest assured that his loving prayers will continue to be offered on their
behalf, and for you and your fellow members of the N.S.A., who are serving
with such devotion and self-sacrifice the Holy Faith.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>

<p n="1">Your letter to the Guardian of Feb. 2nd, as well as the copy of your
letter to one of the friends, was received last night, and the Guardian has
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He quite understands how you have felt undecided as to the right course
of action for you to take in the matter of giving the N.S.A. of Australia and
New Zealand legal rights over the body of dear Father Dunn.  However, he
feels you need not hesitate to take this step, and thus empower that Assembly,
at some future date, to remove his remains to some other spot, more especially
so, as your son has no objection to this arrangement.</p>

<p n="3">Such matters can so easily be arranged when people are living, but if
they are not provided for it becomes a most laborious, and, in some cases,
almost impossible task, once they have passed on.</p>

<p n="4">It is only natural that the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of that Continent should, at some
future date, wish to place Father Dunn's body in the midst of a purely <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>

legal right at present, for both his and your own transfer.</p>

<p n="5">We cannot, of course, at present foresee the nature of future events.
But we can be absolutely sure that, as time passes and the glory of the Faith
rises up for all the world to see, the love and respect the various <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities feel for their pioneers, their teachers, and outstanding figures,
will increase.  Therefore, the Guardian feels that it is only right that the

before you, wherever they feel your graves will be of greatest service to the
Faith.  This of course is subject to you yourself feeling perfectly happy to
give them this right.</p>

<p n="6">The Guardian never forgets dear Father Dunn.  His thoughts, too, are
often with you, and his prayers are offered on your behalf, that you may go
on serving the beloved Faith for many years to come.</p>

<p n="1">The Guardian was both surprised and pleased to receive your <w type="dw">Naw-Ruz</w>

<p n="2">To know that there is now, far off in Tasmania, an active and devoted

this Faith that at such a time, far from weakening or being temporarily
eclipsed by the terrible tragedies taking place in the world at present, it is
growing and spreading and striking new roots all over the world!</p>

<p n="3">The task facing the young <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in particular, is very great.  For they
are the ones who, with their fellow youth the world over, will be called
upon after the war to help build the future, and we are assured that a future
without the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> principles to guide it, will be as unsound and fruitless as
post-war reconstruction since 1918 has proved to be.  Therefore the Guardian

James Heggie was born in Scotland, and later moved to Canada.  He moved to
Australia in 1935 and heard of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith in October 1937 from Oswald
Whitaker.  After studying Chiropractic in North America from 1939, Jim enlisted
in the Australian Army's Medical Corp. at the outbreak of war, hoping to be
posted in the Middle East so that he could visit Shoghi Effendi and the Holy
Land.  This he did in December 1941.  In 1947 Jim married Merle Brooks of
Adelaide.  That year, also, he was elected to the National Assembly and became
Secretary.  In 1948 the Heggies moved to Brisbane to work toward the formation
of the first Assembly there.  They subsequently helped to establish Hunters
Hill Local Assembly in Sydney.  Jim was a student of Islam, producing as early as
1946 a "study index" to the <bibl><title>Koran</title></bibl>.  He later produced other concordances and
indexes.  He learnt Braille, and produced <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> books for the blind.  He was
secretary of the National Assembly from the early years of the Ten Year Crusade,
and during the period in which the Sydney <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w> was planned
and constructed.  For a decade and more he printed the programs for Sunday
services.  He died in 1992.</note>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1"><pb n="189"/>Your letter of April 12th was received safely, and the Guardian was
very happy to see you had gotten back safely to Australia.  He has instructed
me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">It was indeed a great blessing for you that you should have been able,
during this world war, to reach the Shores of the Holy Land and make the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> pilgrimage, even though your time was necessarily short.  He hopes
someday you will again visit Haifa and spend more time.</p>

<p n="3">The difficulties and problems you mention in your letter are ones with
which the Guardian is familiar, and he certainly does not mind your
mentioning them.  On the contrary, he appreciates hearing about them first
hand, and is glad you felt free to write to him.  This is as it should be.</p>

<p n="4">The believers, when few in numbers especially, find themselves called
upon to take part in a system infinitely beyond their own personal stage of
development.  The laws and principles of the Cause are designed to embrace
the planet itself; how can they possibly, at the inception of their practice,
work smoothly with a mere handful of people, however sincere and zealous
they may be?  Especially as most of the believers the world over at present
are adults who change into <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,and not people who from childhood
have known no other outlook except the exalted outlook the teachings
bring.</p>

<p n="5">The difficulties you mention exist more or less everywhere.  But as the
numbers of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> increase and the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> themselves become more
spiritually mature, all these small but regrettable characteristics of community
life will gradually disappear.</p>

<p n="6">Of course the letters of the Guardian, as he has pointed out in a recent
letter to the N.S.A., could never confer on any individual a power or function
higher than that of the Spiritual Assembly--an institution he himself has
been at the greatest pains to establish!  It is very unfortunate that anyone
should so misinterpret the spirit and meaning of his letters.</p>

<p n="7">He assures you he will continue to remember you in his prayers, and he
cherishes great hopes for your future services to our beloved Faith.</p>

<p n="2">He was delighted to hear that the Cause in Adelaide is making such
good progress, and that many new and fine souls have embraced the Faith
there.</p>

<p n="3">He was also very happy to hear Jim Heggie has been with you all and is
so active in helping the friends all he can and in starting a youth group.  He
is a very fine young <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>, and the Guardian enjoyed meeting him very
much.  He hopes in the future many more of the Australian &amp; New Zealand
friends will be able to visit Haifa.</p>

<p n="4">The Cause is still in its infancy, and when one remembers this, and all
it has had to contend with in the line of persecution and oppression for
almost a hundred years, it is indeed a miracle that in such widely distant
lands as South America and Australia, Europe, and Asia, there should be
flourishing centres of devoted and active and growing believers, growing

<p n="3">The friends must be patient with each other and, must realize that the

they fall within separate civic units--towns, townships, etc--but in America

<p n="1">Your letters, written on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly, and
dated April 21st, 1942 and Nov. 18th, 1942, reached the Guardian, together
with their enclosures, and he has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He regrets the delay in replying to them, but he has been, and still is,
engaged on a work which requires a tremendous amount of his time, and his
correspondence has, of necessity, suffered from it.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian would prefer sending all cables and moneys etc, to you
direct, but the war regulations, as enforced in this country, prohibit the use
<pb n="195"/>of a postal address in cables or telegrams, and as he does not have your street
address, he has had to do it this way.  Please forward your own address, or the
one you care to have used, and it will simplify matters in the future.</p>

<p n="4">He is delighted to hear that the friends will be able to hold a Convention
in April, and he hopes that through its deliberations and the meetings of
the N.S.A. members, far reaching teaching plans will be set afoot and the
Cause in New Zealand and Australia obtain a new impetus.  You already
have the nuclei of a number of Spiritual Assemblies in places where there
are a group of believers, and he hopes that through following the methods,
so successful in such countries as India and the United States, of having
both travelling teachers and pioneers or settlers go out, you will have a
number of new Spiritual Assemblies by 1944.</p>

<p n="5">He was very pleased to see the increased interest among the friends in
their various <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer and Winter Schools, and hopes that these will
increasingly attract students of the Faith anxious to deepen their knowledge
of its wonderful teachings.</p>

<p n="6">The Australian and New Zealand friends, now feeling the full weight
of the war, its dangers and sorrows, are very often in his prayers.  He feels
confident that they will emerge from these dark years stronger in spirit,
more united and consecrated than ever before.  They have a great and
precious mission before them of rearing, albeit in miniature, the pattern of
a New World Order, divine in origin, in the midst of their countrymen, who
someday are sure to turn to that pattern as the solution of their problems
and the harbinger of their happiness.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter of May 28th has been received, together with the newspaper
clippings you enclosed, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer you
on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He was very pleased to receive the completed file of clippings, which
he found very interesting, and he thanks you for sending them to him.</p>

<p n="3">The broad and tolerant attitude of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> presents such a sharp
contrast to the prejudice and intolerance (however sincere) of the members
of the clergy who have denounced the teachings of the Faith, that it cannot
but excite the interest and admiration of disinterested readers.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian hopes that the Australian friends will exert their utmost,
during these last months of our first <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> century, to bring the Faith to the
knowledge of the public, attract and confirm new souls, and consolidate its
institutions everywhere.</p>

<p n="5">He deeply values your and your husband's tireless services, and will
often remember you in his prayers.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter dated April 6th reached the Guardian, together with
enclosed draft for L30--the receipt for which I am enclosing herewith--and
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He regrets very much that you should have felt, for even a moment,
that there was some special reason for his forwarding sums through Mr.
Bolton.  The matter was entirely impersonal, and was due to strict rules
governing the addressing of telegrams and cables during war time; no post
office box addresses being accepted here any more.  Therefore the Guardian,
being sure that Mr. Bolton's address was a permanent one, and the money
would not go astray, sent it in his care.  He experienced similar difficulties in
communicating with all centers which had only forwarded to him a P.O.
Box address.  He now has secured Miss Hilda Brooks' permanent address
which will facilitate communications by cable with the N.S.A.</p>

<p n="3">He hopes you will continue to serve the N.S.A. in whatever way they
may require of you, and continue to do your utmost to promote the Faith in
all fields, both locally and nationally.</p>

<p n="4">The most urgent requirement of the Faith in Australia at present is in
the teaching field, and he is very anxious for the friends to arise and extend
their activities as much as possible in that vast country.</p>

<p n="5">He deeply appreciates the efforts of the Adelaide friends to establish a
permanent summer school, but as long as this will dissipate the efforts of the
friends, who must now concentrate on one summer school in Australia, and
will also detract from the all-important necessity of devoting all attention
and resources to the teaching work, he does not approve of the establishment
of such an institution at present.</p>

<p n="6">Please assure the friends of his high hopes for the success of their
contemplated work in all fields and rest assured his loving prayers are offered
for you personally, and for the N.S.A. and the believers.</p>

P.S.  He is happy to hear Mr Appleton<note n="73" type="foot">Matthew and Dorothy Appleton became <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in Adelaide in 1931.  In the
1930s Matt served on the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl> committee.  He was one of the few
Australian <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> who served in the armed forces during the Second World
War.  Upon his return to Adelaide he served on the Regional Teaching
Committee for South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Broken Hill.
In 1946 the Appletons transferred to Yerrinbool, where they lived in the "annex"
at the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> School.  Dorothy served on the School Committee, and both served
on Yerrinbool Local Assembly.  Matt was delegate to National Convention in
1949, elected to the National Assembly and became its vice-chairman.  In 1950
the Appletons transferred to Port Lincoln in South Australia.</note> has returned safely home and is active in
The Cause.  He was received here with great pleasure as the Australian and New
Zealand friends are always welcome.

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter of May 19th has been received, and the beloved Guardian
has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian was surprised to hear that the friends of Adelaide have
embarked on such an expensive project as the purchase of a house and
property at such a time.  He fully realizes, however, that it is nothing but
their keen desire to further the interests of the Faith in everyway that has
led them to this step.  In this connection he would like to say that he does
not consider it wise for the Australian friends to have more than one Summer
School at present, as it will dissipate their forces and be an unnecessary
burden on their resources.  If the friends wish to maintain this property they
have recently purchased, he would suggest that they convert it into their
local administrative headquarters and meeting place.  This matter is one for
the Local Assembly to decide, preferably in consultation with the National
Assembly.</p>

<p n="3">The most urgent task facing the friends of Australia at present is the
teaching work, and the Guardian is eagerly awaiting news of their activities
in this field.</p>

<p n="4">Please convey his loving greetings to all the friends.  He is pleased to
hear Mr. Appleton arrived safely home, and is so active in the work there.</p>

(d. 1979) was introduced to the Faith by Stanley and Mariette Bolton, and joined
in 1941.  She was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly 1945 -- 46, and a
member of Hunter's Hill Local Assembly from its beginning.  From February
1948 to February 1949 and again in 1951 with her daughter Alicia, she greatly
assisted <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities in Europe in their early post-war teaching activities.
In 1948, for instance, at the request of the British NSA she undertook a teaching
trip to the Midlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Ireland.  In the early 1950s Mrs.
Hutchinson-Smith and her daughter Alicia lived for a period in Germany, before
once more returning to Sydney.  Alicia became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in Sydney 1947 -- 8, and
has been a long-time member of the Hunters Hill community.</note>

<p n="1">Your letters dated Nov 18th and Oct. 2nd and Dec. 29th have been
received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He very deeply appreciates all the trouble you personally have gone to
in order to find a suitable building for the National <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Headquarters
and the efforts of other devoted friends.</p>

<p n="3">The most important thing of all has been successfully accomplished:
you have succeeded in purchasing, within city limits, a suitable building
and well in time for it to be furnished and in use before the centenary
celebrations next May.</p>

<p n="4">In regard to the question you raise about a secretary: this is, of course,
a matter to be decided by the N.S.A. but in most countries where the work
of the N.S.A. has become sufficiently involved to necessitate it, the secretary
of the N.S.A. has assistant secretaries.  If Miss Brooks is unable, for family
reasons, to take up her residence in Sydney, an assistant secretary could do
so.  Of course the actual secretary of the N.S.A. must be a member of it; the
assistant need not be.</p>

<p n="5"><pb n="208"/>It is a source of great happiness to the Guardian that now all the
countries possessing an N.S.A. have also a Nat. Ad. Headquarters of their
own, and will be able to meet the requirements of the new century ahead of
us better equipped to handle the ever increasing work of the Faith.</p>

<p n="1">Your letters dated June 8th, Sept 12th, Nov 12th, Jan 10th and 17th,
1944, together with their enclosures have all been received, and the Guardian
has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.  He has also received the
envelope of photographs you sent of N.S.A. members, Father Dunn's grave
and other pictures of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> friends, for which he thanks you.  He also wishes
to thank you for your manuscript for the <bibl><title level="j"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World</title></bibl> which was also
received safely.</p>

<p n="2">In regard to the recently purchased National Headquarters in Sydney:
He was delighted that you were able to take possession of a house suitable to
the present requirements of the Faith, and he trusts that by the time this
reaches you all the legal steps will have been completed and the building
registered in the name of the National Spiritual Assembly.  It should be
<pb n="209"/>called by its proper title of "<w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w>".</p>

<p n="3">The ideal to be followed, of course, is for the secretariat, the office of
the treasurer, etc., to be in the National Headquarters.  However, this can
be brought about gradually, and he leaves decisions in this matter to the
N.S.A.</p>

<p n="4">He trusts that the combined Centenary Celebrations and annual
convention will not only draw a large group of believers to Sydney to meet
in their new <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w>, but will also be a means of attracting the
attention of the public to the Faith on a wider scale than ever before.  The
Australian and New Zealand friends are standing not only on the threshold
of the second <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> century but also on the threshold of a new phase of the
Cause in that part of the world.  Their responsibilities are therefore greatly
increased, and he believes they will meet them unitedly, with clear vision,
and their characteristic devotion to our beloved Faith.</p>

with the Centenary Celebrations which embrace the 23rd of May.  The
Commemoration gathering should be held on the 22nd of May exactly at

established in Sydney I trust and pray that this central administrative headquarters
in the oldest and leading <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> centre in that far-off continent will act as a powerful
magnet and attract the manifold blessings of the Almighty and lend a tremendous
impetus to the organised activities of the believers in Australia and New Zealand.

<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The work accomplished by the Australian and New Zealand believers in recent
years, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activity, culminating
in the splendid celebrations at the newly established national headquarters in the
capital city of the Australian Commonwealth, is highly praiseworthy and augurs
well for the future.  The opening years of the new century must witness a stupendous
effort on the part of the newly established community in the teaching field--an
effort at once nation-wide, systematic, strenuous and persistent.  The multiplication
of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> centres in towns and villages, a greater measure of publicity, a higher
degree of unity and consecration to the Faith, a fuller measure of self-sacrifice
should distinguish the labours of the members of this community.  I will pray from

speedy realization of every hope you cherish for the promotion of His Faith and the

<p n="1">Your letter of Aug. 20th has been received, and the beloved Guardian
has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2"><pb n="215"/>First let me assure you he is very happy to hear the Port Adelaide work
is progressing, and he hopes you will be able, with the help of other dear
friends, to establish an Assembly there soon.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian feels that there seems to be some lack of clarity on the
matter of his receiving and answering letters from individual believers.  Any
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> is free to write their Guardian.  He almost invariably encourages the
friends in their work for the Cause.  But sometimes the impression has arisen
(many times in the U.S.A. and other countries) that an instruction to teach
or serve in some way, which an individual receives from him, places him
beyond the jurisdiction of the Assembly; this, of course, is not so as he
could never encourage the friends to break regulations he has himself for
years been at great pains to see maintained for the good of the Cause.</p>

<p n="4">So many misunderstandings arise from the passionate attachment of
the friends to the Faith and also their immaturity.  We must therefore be
very patient and loving with each other and try to establish unity in the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> family.  The differences--very unfortunate--which you describe in
your letter he feels are caused by the above and not by enmity to the Faith
or insincerity.</p>

<p n="5">He urges you to do your utmost to create a greater love and harmony
in the community, and to persevere in teaching the Holy Faith.  He will
pray for you, your dear husband and the Appletons to whom he sends loving

<p n="1">The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated
June 8th, 21st. and Aug 4th., and to thank you for the reports of your work
enclosed.</p>

<p n="2">He recently received very warm letters from the members of the
Caringbah group, and he was very happy to see that a new Assembly is well
on the way to being formed and that you have so actively aided in the
teaching work there.  He hopes that the other centers where you have been
teaching will also soon rise to Assembly status and thus enrich the number
of administrative units in that vast country.</p>

<p n="3">He was also very pleased to see that the sessions of the Yerrinbool School
had been so successful and that two such enlightened youth as Lilian and
Frank Wyss had expressed their intention of joining the Faith.  Please extend
to these two young people a hearty welcome into the Cause on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi.</p>

<p n="4"><pb n="218"/>He was likewise very glad to see that Effie Baker was able to be present
and mingle with the friends.</p>

<p n="5">During your trip to the United States he would suggest you get in touch
with the Nat. Teaching Com. (Mr. Leroy Ioas of San Francisco is Chairman)
and offer to do any lecturing or teaching which could fit in with both your
plans and theirs.  It always stimulates the work to have a believer from a
distant land visit the friends and give them news.</p>

<p n="6">The Guardian does not feel that two Summer Schools in such close
proximity are advisable.  In fact he considers Yerrinbool sufficient for the
present needs of the Cause in Australia.</p>

<p n="7">You may be sure he will pray for you and your dear children and husband

<p n="1">The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write your National
Spiritual Assembly and inform you of his views and wishes in connection
with the Summer School in Australia:</p>

<p n="2">He does not consider it either wise or necessary at the present time to
have more than one <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer School in Australia, and as Yerrinbool
is equipped to accommodate the friends on <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> property, so to speak, he
would suggest that Yerrinbool continue to be used as the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Summer School.</p>

<p n="3">He pointed out this same principle of not multiplying the number of
Summer Schools some time ago in connection with the Adelaide Assembly's
purchase of a building and property.</p>

<p n="4">He has also done the same thing in America--limited the number of
Summer Schools--as the friends in their enthusiasm to inaugurate new
institutions wanted to have very many Summer Schools which would have
not only weakened, instead of strengthening, the older schools, but also
would have dissipated the energy of the friends.</p>

<p n="1"><pb n="220"/>Your letter of Feb. 9th has been received (written on behalf of the
N.S.A.), and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his
behalf and to also acknowledge receipt of the copy of the resolutions which
you forwarded in it.</p>

<p n="2">The news you conveyed was all very encouraging and pleased him
greatly.</p>

<p n="3">He was particularly happy to hear of the formation of a new Spiritual
Assembly at Caringbah as this marks an important step forward in the growth
of the Cause and its administrative institutions in Australia.  He hopes that
the N.S.A. will, through travelling and visiting teachers, and <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> settlers
and pioneers, be able to speedily ensure the establishment of further
Assemblies; wherever the conditions for their development seem most
promising, the efforts should be concentrated.</p>

<p n="4">He was also very glad to hear that the <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> has been
successfully transferred to the name of the National Assembly.  He is looking
forward to receiving the photographs of its opening, and of the Centenary
dinner, which you are sending him.  Likewise he was pleased to see it is
being put to such active use and teaching classes, public meetings, etc, being
held in it.</p>

<p n="5">He cannot stress too much the vital importance of the teaching work,
and he hopes that all the believers, however circumscribed their means,
however unqualified they may feel themselves to be, will arise and contribute
their share to this all-important work.  The Cause has, all things considered,
made remarkable progress in Australia and New Zealand of late; but the
united efforts of all the friends are required to spread the Divine Message
during these moving and dark times the world is passing through.  They
must fix their eyes on the abject misery of humanity and, forgetful of their
own limitations, deliver the Teachings to their fellow countrymen.</p>

<p n="6">He assures you and your co-workers that he deeply appreciates your
devoted services, and will constantly pray for the progress of the Faith in

<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>

<pb n="221"/>The teaching responsibilities confronting the Australian and New Zealand
believers are of supreme importance and of extreme urgency.  Now that the basis
of the Administrative Order has been firmly laid, and fully understood, and the
National <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> established in the leading city of the Australian
Commonwealth, the attention of the members of the entire community must be
focussed on the teaching work--the promotion of which is the ultimate object of the
entire machinery of the Administrative Order and its subsidiary institutions and
agencies.  The multiplication of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> groups, the steady increase in the number
of Local Assemblies, the dissemination of literature, the dispersal of the believers,
no matter how small their number, to important centres throughout the continent
constitute the vital task of the infant community which has, despite its limited
resources and isolated situation, demonstrated its capacity to establish on a sound
basis the primary institutions of the Faith to safeguard its unity and promote its
vital interests.  That it may forge ahead and overcome every obstacle in its path
and fulfil its high destiny is my fondest hope and constant prayer.

and thus carry on the glorious tradition you and Father Dunn established in
Australia.  No doubt your dear husband's spirit, likewise, rejoices to see you
carrying on the work so dear to him!</p>

<p n="3">There seems to be some misapprehension about the term "official
teacher"; we have no such thing as official teachers; all can and should
teach the Cause.  The term cannot be applied to anyone.  Sometimes a
believer is sent out on a teaching trip and receive help from the National

North America, and after meeting the Dunns in the 1930s devoted all her time
and energy to the propagation and administration of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith (although
she did not officially become a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> until 1947).  In the Six Year Plan (1947 ??
1953) Thelma accompanied Clara Dunn on her visits to <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in several

country towns that were then the focus of attention.  She was elected to the

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1"><pb n="226"/>The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated
April 12th, 13th (two) and 14th, and to acknowledge receipt of the
enclosures forwarded with them.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding the matter of Mrs Dobbins and the inharmony that seems
to exist among certain of the friends in Adelaide: when <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> permit the
dark forces of the world to enter into their own relationships within the
Faith they gravely jeopardise its progress; it is the paramount duty of the
believers, the Local Assemblies, and particularly the N.S.A. to foster
harmony, understanding and love amongst the friends.  All should be ready
and willing to set aside every personal sense of grievance--justified or
unjustified--for the good of the Cause, because the people will never embrace
it until they see in its community life mirrored what is so conspicuously
lacking in the world: love and unity.</p>

<p n="3">The <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> are fully entitled to address criticisms to their Assemblies;
they can freely air their views about policies or individual members of elected
bodies to the Assembly, local or national, but then they must whole-heartedly
accept the advice or decision of the Assembly, according to the principles
already laid down for such matters in <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> administration.</p>

<p n="4">Shoghi Effendi has repeatedly stated, to believers in every part of the
world, that the individual <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> are entirely free to write to him on any
matter they please; naturally he is equally free to answer them in any manner
he pleases.  At the present time, when the institutions of the Cause are just
beginning to function, he considers it essential to keep up this large
correspondence, much as it adds to his many other burdens.  It is sometimes
the case that the very first intimation he receives of some important step
influencing the interests of the Faith, one way or another, comes from an
individual's letter instead of from an Assembly; it would naturally be
preferable for the information to come from an administrative body, but
whatever the source, the Guardian is solely concerned with the welfare of
the Faith, and when he deems a certain step detrimental he states his views
in his reply.  This he is at entire liberty to do.</p>

<p n="5">Just as the National Assembly has full jurisdiction over all its Local
Assemblies, the Guardian has full jurisdiction over all National Assemblies;
he is not required to consult them, if he believes a certain decision is advisable
in the interests of the Cause.  He is the judge of the wisdom and advisability
of the decisions made by these bodies, and not they of the wisdom and
advisability of his decisions.  A perusal of the <bibl><title>Will and Testament</title></bibl> makes
this principle quite clear.</p>

<p n="6">He is the Guardian of the Cause in the very fullness of that term, and
the appointed interpreter of its teachings, and is guided in his decisions to
do that which protects it and fosters its growth and highest interests.</p>

<p n="7"><pb n="227"/>He always has the right to step in and countermand the decisions of a
National Assembly; if he did not possess this right he would be absolutely
impotent to protect the Faith, just as the N.S.A., if it were divested of the
right to countermand the decisions of a Local Assembly, would be incapable
of watching over and guiding the national welfare of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community.</p>

<p n="8">It very seldom happens--but it nevertheless <emph rend="underscore">does</emph> happen--that he feels
impelled to change a major (as you put it) decision of an N.S.A.; but he
always unhesitatingly does so when necessary, and the N.S.A. in question
should gladly and unhesitatingly accept this as a measure designed for the
good of the Faith which its elected representatives are so devotedly seeking
to serve.</p>

<p n="9">Regarding the position of Summer Schools in Australia: much of what
you are at present going through has already been experienced by the
American <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community, and he sympathises with your views and
problems; however, he wishes to state the following:</p>

<p n="10">Whatever the history of the Yerrinbool School may be, the fact remains
it is now in existence, is owned by believers ready to have it used as such,
and is known as a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer School all over the world.  The Guardian
is not the least concerned with personalities in this matter, but with
principles.  He feels at the <emph rend="underscore">present time</emph> that one <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer School is
enough for the believers of Australia to maintain.  In the future, as Assemblies
and groups multiply, the question will naturally have to be reconsidered.</p>

<p n="11"><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer Schools in the United States originated in the same
informal manner as Yerrinbool; they were (and some still are) the property
of individual believers who resided on them, but they are administered by
Committees appointed by the N.S.A. and which usually include, out of
courtesy and consideration, the owners.  The American friends also desired
to have many more Summer Schools, but the Guardian has so far not
permitted them to add to the number, as it dissipates the energy and funds
of the believers and would at present weaken those already existing.</p>

<p n="12">He feels that the duty of your Assembly is to not give up Yerrinbool
because of any inharmony over it, but to administer and support it properly
and remove the inharmony.  You should appoint a Committee for the School,
purchase any extra equipment needed for the comfort and accommodation
of the attendants, and he feels sure the Boltons will cooperate with you in
this matter, as they are eager to have the property be used by the believers.</p>

<p n="13">Generally speaking he does not encourage the erection of buildings in
memory to individual believers at the present time.  But as those at Yerrinbool
serve a useful purpose and that the memory of dear Father Dunn
commemorates the life of the man who brought the Faith to the continent
of Australia, we may welcome it in the spirit it was given.</p>

<p n="14"><pb n="228"/>As to what uses should be made of the building purchased by the S.A.
of Adelaide, he leaves the decision to your body and that Assembly.  He
hopes that at a future date it can be used as a Summer School.</p>

<p n="15">It is the duty of the N.S.A. to exercise the greatest wisdom, forbearance
and tact in handling the affairs of the Cause.  Many of the differences which
arise between the believers are due to their immaturity, their extreme zeal
and sincerity.</p>

<p n="16">He will pray for you all in the Holy Shrines, that the Beloved may
assist and strengthen you in the discharge of your sacred duties to the Faith
and its adherents in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

the teaching work is, of course, of paramount importance, and the friends

One of the signs of the perfection of our teachings is the way young people

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>

<p n="1">The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated
June 12th, 15th and 25th, and to acknowledge receipt of the numerous
<pb n="230"/>enclosures you forwarded with them.</p>

<p n="2">As he has already expressed to you in his recent messages he greatly
regretted the tone of certain communications from the NSA.  He cannot
too strongly point out to you all that any condition of inharmony places in
jeopardy the wonderful achievements recently made in the spread and
consolidation of the Cause in Australia and New Zealand.  The beloved
Master pointed out over and over again that unity and love among the
friends promotes harmony and the rapid spread of the Faith, and that when
these are sacrificed and disputes, anger and violent criticism take their place
the Cause <emph rend="italics">cannot</emph> move forward.</p>

<p n="3">The N.S.A.s the world over, owing to the spiritual immaturity of the
believers, must at the present time exert the greatest patience in dealing
with the friends; otherwise, as seems to be rapidly becoming the case in
Australia, the friends will take sides, bitterness will increase and what started
out as a small thing (however unjustified and regrettable a departure from
the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> spirit) will become a menace to the progress of the Faith and
definitely retard its progress.</p>

<p n="4">He feels that Mrs Dobbins and Miss Brooks, both of whom love their
religion and are devoted to its promotion, should be called upon to forget
and forgive the past, and concentrate on serving the Faith.  These are the
ways in which the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> can demonstrate true spiritual nobility and
detachment.  In such delicate and complicated cases, the N.S.A. should
appeal to the believers to put the interests of the Cause <emph rend="italics">first</emph>, regardless of
any personal sacrifice of feelings this may require.</p>

<p n="5">He assures you he will pray ardently for the speedy and satisfactory
solution of this entire matter.</p>

<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>

It is my fervent hope and prayer that the members of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities

Order of their Faith has been erected, redouble their efforts to proclaim, with one
voice and in a most effective manner, those vital and healing principles for which
the great mass of their war-weary and much tested countrymen are hungering.
This supreme issue must have precedence over all other considerations, must be
given immediate and anxious attention, must be faced courageously and continually,
and be regarded by individual believers as well as their elected representatives as
the supreme objective of the manifold administrative institutions they have reared
and are still labouring to establish.  Complete harmony, mutual understanding,
unity of purpose, coordination of efforts, prayerful consideration of, and mature
deliberation on, all the aspects and requirements of this great and sacred objective
<pb n="231"/>can alone ensure its triumphant consummation during these years of stress and
peril through which mankind is passing.  May the national elected representatives
of both communities set a superb example to their fellow-workers throughout that
far-off continent, and enable them to win memorable victories in the service of
their glorious Faith and its God-given institutions.

<pb n="233"/>you on his behalf, and to welcome you into our beloved Cause, which you
and your dear wife have embraced with so much devotion and sincere
conviction.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding the questions you have asked: the general principle laid down
by the Guardian is that there should be one Spiritual Assembly in each
civic area.  For instance, New York City, with its immense population and
wide-spread boroughs only has one S.A. in accordance with this obviously
logical principle.  How this should be applied in detail is a matter for the
various Nat. Spiritual Assemblies to decide, and your N.S.A. must of course
apply this rule to Australia and New Zealand.  However, fireside teaching
classes can be held, and should be held, by as many of the believers as possible
in order to reach people with the teachings.</p>

<p n="3">As to your other questions:</p>

<p n="4">No 1. The Maxwell notes have the same status as other pilgrims notes;
they are of value, but are not the verbatim report of the Guardian's words.</p>

<p n="5">No 2. In <bibl><title>God Passes By</title></bibl> you will find reference to the "son of the wolf"
and who he was.</p>

<p n="6">No 3. We cannot say more about the Seventh Angel than what the Master
has stated in <bibl><title>Some Answered Questions</title></bibl>.</p>

<p n="7">No 4. <bibl><title>The Chosen Highway</title></bibl> has the same status as pilgrims' notes; it is a
very interesting book but some of the statements must be taken as hearsay
only.</p>

<p n="8">No. 5 -- 6. These are questions for scholars to decide; the Guardian always
recommends that we refer to experts in such matters.</p>

<p n="9">No. 7. Mrs Kehler's statements are obviously hearsay, and the Guardian
cannot corroborate them.  Islam, like Christianity, however, has been split
up into many sects.</p>

<p n="10">No. 8. As I just mentioned above, not every statement in Lady Blomfield's
book can be considered absolutely accurate.</p>

<p n="11">No. 9. There is no objection to the Adelaide S.A. keeping a record of the
names of contributors, and sums received; but no pressure must ever be
brought on the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> to contribute, it must be voluntary, and should be

<p n="12">No. 10. The Guardian suggests you try and procure ring stones from the Indian
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,as they are usually made in the East.</p>

<p n="13">No. 11. There is no direct reference to atomic bombs in the teachings, but
many references to the powers latent within the universe; atomic force is
obviously one of these powers.</p>

<p n="14">No. 12. The darkening of the sun, moon and stars is purely symbolic, and
refers to the advent of the Manifestation of God, which has already taken

<p n="15">No. 13. The best answer is that we do not believe in taking such a statement

<salute>Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter, dated June 16th, with the enclosures you forwarded in it,
was received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his
behalf.</p>

<p n="2">Since you have turned to him for guidance, he will very frankly give
you his opinion.</p>

<p n="3">He feels that the present inharmony prevailing amongst you, Miss
.......... , and some other members of the Faith there, is very detrimental to
the advancement of the Cause, and can only lead to disruption and the
chilling of the interest of new believers.  You, Miss .......... , and all the other
believers there should forget about your personal grievances, and unite for
the protection of the Faith which he well knows you are all loyally devoted
to and ready to sacrifice for.</p>

<p n="4">Perhaps the greatest test <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> are ever subjected to is from each
other; but for the sake of the Master they should be ever ready to overlook
each others' mistakes, apologize for harsh words they have uttered, forgive
and forget.  He strongly recommends to you this course of action.</p>

<p n="5">Also he feels that you and Mr. .......... should not remain away from
the meetings and Feasts in Adelaide; you have now got an enthusiastic
group of young <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in Port Adelaide, and you should show them a strong
example of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> discipline and the unity which can and must prevail
amongst the community of the Most Great Name.</p>

<p n="6">The civic area in which S.A.s can be formed is an administrative matter
<pb n="235"/>for the N.S.A. to decide.</p>

<p n="7">Please assure dear Mother Dunn of his loving prayers on her behalf,
and his appreciation of her devoted services.</p>

<salute>[National Spiritual Assembly]
<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letters, written on behalf of the N.S.A. and dated June 15th 1945,
and 16th, July 26th and Sep. 15th, 1945, and Jan. 7th, 1946, together with
their enclosures, have been received, and the Guardian has instructed me
to answer them on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He is very pleased to see the progress the Cause is making in Australia
and New Zealand, and hopes that the N.S.A. will not only inspire and
encourage the believers in their teaching activities, but will also constantly
impress on them the need for the greatest love and unity to prevail in their
midst; the masses will only really turn to the Faith when they see that in it
true religion is practiced as well as preached!</p>

<p n="3">The recent articles attacking the Cause are a sign that its influence is
sufficiently felt to be feared--a great compliment to the progress you are making in spreading the message!<note n="86" type="foot">In <bibl><date>1945 -- 46</date> articles appeared in the <pubPlace>Sydney and Hobart</pubPlace> <edition>editions</edition> of <title>Truth</title> (<date>July

<p n="4">Concerning the various points raised in your letters:</p>

<p n="5">He noticed from your letter of January 7th, that you were planning to
hold the annual Convention in May, and cabled you, that it must be held in
the Ridvan period--as are all the other National <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> conventions the
world over,--even though some other date might be more convenient locally.</p>

<p n="6">He feels that the Yerrinbool Summer School should hold longer sessions;
in this respect the friends cannot do better than to pattern themselves on
the American Summer Schools, some of which now hold two or three
summer sessions, and even a "Winter Session".  Although such a large number
of sessions may be premature for Australia at present, the goal should be
kept in mind as you seek to expand your school.</p>

<p n="7">There can be no schism in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith because the Guardianship
is established on an unassailable foundation, supported by a signed, sealed
<pb n="238"/>document--the Will.  Schism can only flourish where there is ambiguity or
no specific proof.  The New History Society is like a branch that has no
roots and will soon dry up and wither.  It has not caused, nor can it cause a
breach among the believers.</p>

<p n="8">He was very happy to see you are now establishing Regional Teaching
Committees, and hopes you will concentrate all your resources and the energy
of the friends, on establishing new Assemblies and groups.</p>

<p n="9">He assures you, one and all, that his loving prayers will be offered for
your guidance and for the success of your important work.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The activities initiated by the dearly beloved friends in Australia and New
Zealand, and so diligently promoted by them all are highly meritorious, and will,
no doubt, bear abundant fruit in the days to come.  The utmost effort should be
exerted by individuals as well as Local Assemblies to increase the number of the
active supporters of the Faith and to enable them to disperse, to multiply the groups
that must sooner or later evolve into Assemblies, to achieve greater publicity for
the Faith through the radio and the press, to extend the range of the activities of the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith, to foster the institution of the Summer School, and to consolidate
and enlarge the scope of the <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w>.  These are the main objectives that
demand the concentrated attention of the Australian and New Zealand believers
during the months that lie immediately ahead.  No sacrifice is too great to ensure
the realisation of these noble aims.  All must arise and unitedly endeavour to carry
to a successful conclusion these vital tasks, with which the immediate destinies of
the Faith are so closely linked.  That the Beloved may guide and sustain you in all
your undertakings, that He may crown your assiduous labours with magnificent
success is my dearest wish and ardent prayer.

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister,</salute>

<p n="1">Your letter dated April 27th has been received and the beloved
Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  He also acknowledges
receipt of the enclosures forwarded with it.</p>

<p n="2">He trusts that by the time this letter reaches you the complications
which arose at Convention, about the election, will have been satisfactorily
straightened out; as he already cabled you, this was a question for the out-going
N.S.A. to decide.</p>

<p n="3">He feels that the National Spiritual Assembly during the coming year
should focus both its and the believers' attention on the all-important
teaching work, and the necessity of increasing the number of groups and
Assemblies throughout Australia and New Zealand.  The friends should be
urged and encouraged to arise both as pioneers and travelling teachers, and
they should receive, in cases where they cannot afford it themselves, financial
aid from the National Fund.  Such measures are at the present time absolutely
necessary, as the believers are few, the hour very pressing, and most of them
not sufficiently well-off to do such work without assistance.</p>

<p n="4">The <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in the United States have just embarked on their second
Seven Year plan; India is working hard on a Four and a half Year Plan;
England is straining every nerve to achieve, during the Six Year Plan the
friends have chosen for themselves, 19 Assemblies.  It is only right and proper
that such a vast and promising territory as Australia, New Zealand and
Tasmania represents, should likewise win for itself new laurels in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
teaching field during the next few years!  He therefore suggests you choose,
after surveying your own possibilities and soliciting suggestions from the
friends, certain immediate objectives, and then work unitedly towards
achieving them.</p>

<p n="5"><pb n="240"/>He assures you that he will offer special prayers on your behalf, that
the N.S.A. members and the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> they represent, may speedily forge ahead
and enter into a new era of development of the Faith in that distant but
promising land.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The activities in which you are engaged, are the object of my fervent and
constant prayers.  To teach the Faith, to stimulate the dispersal and settlement of
pioneers, to enable the existing groups to attain Assembly status, and to multiply,
steadily and speedily, the number of groups in Australia and New Zealand are the
paramount tasks which demand the constant attention, the prayerful consideration
and united and vigorous collaboration of the believers, and particularly of their
national representatives.  No sacrifice is too great to further these manifold and
noble aims and purposes.  Effective measures, unprecedented in scope, should be
carefully and immediately devised, proclaimed to the believers, and, through
sustained and organised effort, carried into effect.  There is no time to lose.  The
masses, greatly tired by the calamities of the age, restless, disappointed, and eager
to obtain real and complete relief in their hour of trial, hunger for the Message of
the New Day, and will, if properly approached and appealed to, embrace the great
verities it enshrines.  Firm and unassailable unity among those who profess to be its
bearers, unshakeable fidelity to the principles on which it is founded, generous and
unfailing support of the institutions designed to propagate it, are the vital prerequisites
of their urgent and sacred task.  Every consideration, however profitable and
laudable, must for the present be subordinated to the vital needs of the strenuous
task now confronting the Australian and New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities.  The
administrative machinery designed to provide the necessary agency for the diffusion
of the Message has been sufficiently consolidated to enable it to perform the glorious
task for which it was originally erected.  It should be utilised to the fullest possible
extent.  Its scope should simultaneously be enlarged to provide a still wider basis
for the future extension of teaching activities.  May the coming year witness a
notable advance in the organized activities of the community for the furtherance of
so glorious and meritorious a purpose.

<lb/>
Dear Spiritual Friend:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your interesting letter of May 16th has been received and Shoghi Effendi
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf and to assure you that he
much appreciates your warm friendship with the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> and the co-operative
spirit in which you assist them in their activities.</p>

<p n="2">As regards the various points you have raised in your letter:</p>

<p n="3">We must not take many of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> statements as dogmatic
finalities, for there are other points which when added to them round out
the picture.  For instance, when He calls Aristotle and Plato Philosophers of
the East, He is obviously placing them in that category because He believes
they belong more correctly to Eastern culture than the Central European
and the New World cultures of the West.  When He calls the philosophers
of the West materialistic this does not for a moment mean He includes all
Western philosophers for, as you truly point out, many of them have been
very spiritual in their concepts.</p>

<p n="4">When studying at present, in English, the available <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> writings on
the subject of body, mind and spirit, one is handicapped by a certain lack of
clarity because not all were translated by the same person, and also there
are, as you know, still many <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> writings untranslated.  But there is no
doubt that spirit and soul seem to have been interchanged in meaning
sometimes; soul and mind have, likewise, been interchanged in meaning,
no doubt due to difficulties arising from different translations.  What the
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w> do believe though is that we have three aspects of our humanness,
so to speak, a body, a mind and an immortal identity--soul or spirit.  We
believe the mind forms a link between the soul and the body, and the two
interact on each other.</p>

<p n="5">Historians cannot be sure Socrates did not visit the Holy Land.  But
believing as we do that <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> had an intuitive knowledge quite
different from our own, we accept His authority on this matter.</p>

<p n="6">We cannot prove man was always man for this is a fundamental doctrine,
but it is based on the assertion that nothing can exceed its own potentialities,
that everything, a stone, a tree, an animal and a human being existed in
plan, potentially, from the very "beginning" of creation.  We don't believe
man has always had the form of man, but rather that from the outset he was
going to evolve into the human form and species and not be a haphazard
branch of the ape family.</p>

<p n="7">You see our whole approach to each matter is based on the belief that
God sends us divinely inspired Educators; what they tell us is fundamentally
<pb n="242"/>true, what science tells us today is true; tomorrow may be entirely changed
to better explain a new set of facts.</p>

<p n="8">When <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> says man breaks the laws of nature, He means we
shape nature to meet our own ends, as no animal does.  Animals adapt
themselves to better fit in with and benefit from their environment.  But
men both surmount and change environment.  Likewise when he says nature
is devoid of memory he means memory as we have it, not the strange memory
of inherited habits which animals so strikingly possess.</p>

<p n="9">These various statements must be taken in conjunction with all the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings; we cannot get a correct picture by concentrating on just
one phrase.</p>

<p n="10">The Guardian hopes this will better enable you to understand our
wonderful Faith--for a living religion it is, and not merely a philosophy!</p>

<p n="11">He wishes you every success in your labours to promote the unity and
enlightenment of mankind, so sorely needed these days, and he will pray for
your happiness and spiritual advancement.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter of June 20th has been received, and our beloved Guardian
has instructed me to answer it on his behalf, also to acknowledge receipt of
its enclosures.</p>

<p n="2">He was very glad to see that amongst the actions taken by the N.S.A.
at its recent meeting was to allot sums to the Regional Teaching Committees
for teaching campaigns and finance travelling teachers and settlers--if
possible.  He considers this all very important, and he urges you to appeal to
the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> to arise and do pioneer work as their fellow believers are doing
in England, India, Egypt, and America.</p>

<p n="3">He also feels that, if the NSA considers such a course of action feasible,
definite plans should be made for carrying the Cause to certain goal towns;
in other words, a real plan with fixed objectives and a time limit is now
possible for Australia, and should be speedily set in motion.</p>

<p n="4">Likewise, he feels that the N.S.A. should meet more often, even if all
members cannot always be present.  Decisions by correspondence lack the
vitality of those that arise out of active consultation, and now the Faith is
progressing so well there, and has a sound administrative foundation, more
vigorous and systematic action is required.</p>

<p n="5">You may be sure all the members of the Assembly are remembered in
his prayers, and he is supplicating for their guidance and success in the

<salute>Dear and valued co-workers: </salute>
<lb/>
The ever expanding activities of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities of Australia and
New Zealand, so clearly reflected in the reports and minutes forwarded recently
by your Assembly demonstrate the character of the Faith which so powerfully
animates you, testify to the loyalty, the vigour and the devotion with which you
conduct the affairs of a continually growing Faith, proclaim the soundness of the
foundation upon which you are rearing its institutions, and augur well for their
future evolution and triumph.  The attention of the believers throughout all centres
in both communities should now be focussed on the steady multiplication and
consolidation of these institutions which constitute the bedrock of the Administrative
Order of which your Assembly is the appointed trustee and chief promoter.  No
sacrifice is too great for the promotion of such an urgent and vital task.  A supreme
effort, on the part of all, young and old alike, individuals, Assemblies and
committees, is absolutely essential in the course of the present year, and as a
prelude to the initiation of future plans aiming at a still greater development and
further enrichment of the life of both communities.  All secondary matters should
be subordinated to the primary requirements of the present day.  The furtherance
of this noble objective should be made the object of the anxious and sustained
deliberations of your Assembly.  The resources of both communities should be
devoted to such a purpose.  Nothing should be allowed to deflect them from this
course.  If they persevere the blessings of the Almighty will enable them to achieve
exploits far exceeding their fondest expectations.  That they may be graciously aided,
in their labours, by <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> is my fervent hope and prayer.  I feel confident that

<p n="1">The beloved Guardian was very happy to receive news of your activities
through your letter of Aug. 4th, and he has instructed me to answer you on
his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He was particularly glad to hear you are able to give the Message to
many people of importance, as this is a valuable and necessary form of
teaching work.  The fact that you are known as a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in itself must attract
the attention of many people you meet to the Cause, and he hopes that you
will ever-increasingly find ways and means of carrying on your direct <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
work.</p>

<p n="3">He was also very pleased to hear you were able to visit Hobart, and
help the friends there, and also visit many other <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Centers.</p>

<p n="4">He wishes to thank you in advance for the kind gift you and your dear
brother are sending him of photos taken in Bahji, which he will be very
happy to have.</p>

and that you may reach many people with the Cause during the conferences
you mentioned would be taking place.</p>

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated
Sep. 2nd and 16th, and Oct. 22nd and 25th, 1946, and to acknowledge receipt
of enclosures sent in some of them, and also material forwarded under separate
cover.  He regrets very much the delay in replying to these N.S.A.
communications, but he has been very pre-occupied with various pressing
matters the last few months, and his mail has consequently had to wait.</p>

<p n="2">In regard to the various points you raised in your letters:</p>

<p n="3">There is no objection to individual <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> sending <w type="dw">Naw-Ruz</w> cards if
they want to; also the NSA can send them out occasionally, but it should
not become a fixed custom.</p>

<p n="4">He has already cabled you that he approved of increasing the delegates
to the Annual Convention to 19.</p>

<p n="5">He feels that Committees should be left free to elect their own officers.</p>

<p n="6">Prayers translated by other people may be used and memorised by the
friends; they need not be confined to his translations.</p>

<p n="7">He considers that the N.S.A. has every right to examine the ballots if
there is some doubt as to the election having been properly conducted.  By
"preservation" of the ballots is meant that they are preserved in the National
files.</p>

<p n="8">A Convention delegate should certainly be given an opportunity to
report to the community his or her experiences at Convention and
impressions.</p>

<p n="9">As to the whole matter of the incorporation of Assemblies: he cannot
go into the details of such things, as this is the work of the N.S.A.  What he
wants is that the spiritual Assemblies in New Zealand and Australia should
be legally empowered to hold property in their own names; how this can be
done, the best way of doing it, are matters for your Assembly and its legal
advisers to decide.</p>

<p n="10">He feels very strongly that the main thing for your Assembly and all
the believers of both Australia and New Zealand to concentrate on are
teaching plans.  The United States, India, Persia and England are all
embarked on ambitious and bold teaching campaigns, and it is a great pity
that Australia, where the Cause is now firmly established and boasts an
active National Assembly, should not have a definite plan, with fixed goals,
of its own.</p>

<p n="11">When the believers are embarked on a definite teaching schedule there
will be less time for them to constantly occupy themselves with purely
<pb n="246"/>secondary administrative points of procedure.  Teaching is their need, and
the solution to any problems they may feel they have.</p>

<p n="12">He was delighted over the report of the work in Brisbane; this is a step
in the right direction, and should be followed through vigorously.  Please
convey to those who have devotedly served there and brought this group
into being his warm thanks and his admiration for their services.</p>

<p n="13">You may be sure he deeply values the loyal and persevering efforts of
your Assembly to promote the Faith in all its aspects in Australia and New
Zealand.  His loving prayers are offered on your behalf and for the success of
your labours.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
I wish to appeal, through you, to the members of the entire community in both
Australia and New Zealand, to arise, in these opening years of the Second <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
century, and lend, through their concerted, their sustained, and determined efforts,
an unprecedented impetus to the growth of the Faith, the multiplication of its
administrative centers, and the consolidation of its nascent institutions.  The
initiation of a Plan, carefully devised, universally supported, and designed to
promote effectively the vital interests of the Faith, and attain a definite objective
within a specified number of years, would seem, at the present hour, highly desirable
and opportune, and will, as a magnet, attract, to an unprecedented degree, the
blessings of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> on the members of both communities, both individually
and collectively.
<lb/>
Now that the structural basis of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administrative Order has been
firmly and definitely laid in these far-away lands, and the National Headquarters
of that Order established, a systematic effort must be exerted to widen the basis of
that Order, by multiplying the Administrative institutions and forming the necessary
nuclei, which, as they develop and are consolidated, will have to be utilized as the
divinely ordained and most effectual instruments for the proclamation of the Faith
to the masses.
<lb/>
I fully realize how small are your numbers, how circumscribed are your means,
how vast the distances that separate the centres already established.  But I firmly
believe that the initiation of a Plan to remedy the very deficiencies from which the
infant Administrative Order is now suffering, and a firm resolve to carry out its
provisions, as well as a sustained effort to make the necessary sacrifices for its
consummation, will set in motion forces of such magnitude, and draw upon both
communities blessings of such potency, as shall excite the wonder of the believers
themselves, and cause their Faith to enter an era of unprecedented expansion and
marvellous and fruitful development.
<lb/>
The concluding years of the first <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> century have witnessed a notable
<pb n="247"/>progress in the development and consolidation of both communities.  The first decade
of the succeeding century must synchronize with a no less remarkable extension of
that essential administrative foundation on which the future institutions of a
flourishing Faith must repose, and on which its destinies and security must ultimately
depend.
<lb/>
May the spirit of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> guide, sustain and inspire you in the discharge of
the noble and formidable tasks which will face you in the years to come.

<p n="1">The letters from the N.S.A. (some written by the former Secretary)
dated Sep. 2nd, 1946, Feb. 10th, March 9th, April 27th (two of this date),
June 13th and July 10th have been received, as well as their enclosures, and
the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He is very anxious that your Assembly should devote its energies and
resources to prosecuting the teaching work and stimulating and encouraging
the believers to devote their thoughts and time to it.  This is really the solution
to all the small problems and differences of opinion that arise in Australia.
It is the sacred duty of the believers to teach, and one of the reasons for so
painstakingly building up Assemblies is for them to promulgate the Cause
of God, and not to lose their time in discussing details, settling disputes
which should not have arisen between <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,and generally losing
themselves in personalities.</p>

<p n="3">He urges your Assembly to try and create as many Local Assemblies as
possible; large suburbs, if outside the city limits and possessing their own
administration should--if 9 <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> reside in them, form separate assemblies.
This may at first seem to weaken the larger communities; but it will also
challenge all concerned to renew their labours to expand the local
communities and increase their numbers.</p>

<p n="4">Enclosed is a letter to Mr. Featherstone in connection with his letter
sent to the Guardian by your Assembly.</p>

<p n="5">Regarding Mr Dive's appeal; the Guardian feels the best course of action
in this matter is to ask both the believers concerned to forgive and forget
the entire matter.</p>

<p n="6">He does not want the friends to form the habit of taking up a kind of
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> litigation against each other.  Their duties to humanity are too sacred
and urgent in these days, when the Cause is struggling to spread and assert
its independence, for them to spend their precious time, and his precious
time, in this way.  Ask them, therefore, to unite, forget the past, and serve as
never before.</p>

The Plan, on which the National elected representatives of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities of Australia and New Zealand have spontaneously embarked marks
a turning-point, of great spiritual significance, in the evolution of the Faith in
those far-off lands, and is an evidence of the truly remarkable spirit that animates
them as well as the communities they represent.  I welcome this mighty step they
have taken with joy, pride and gratitude, and have hastened to transmit to them
my contribution as a token of my keen appreciation of their high endeavours, of
my confidence in their ability, and of my admiration for their zeal and noble
determination in the service of the Faith.  The attention of the members of both
communities must henceforth be focused on the Plan, its progress, its requirements,
its significance and immediate objectives.  All must participate without exception
without reserve, without delay.  The Administrative Order which they have laboured
to establish must henceforth, through its organs and agencies be utilized for the
promotion of this vital purpose, this supreme end.  For no other purpose was it

<p n="1">Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 12th has been received,
and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  The previous letter you
mention cannot have reached him; as he always replies to letters from the
friends.</p>

<p n="2">Your book touches on a very important subject, and he regrets that he
cannot read it himself.  His work is so pressing and multiplying so fast
that he invariably refuses to go over the manuscripts the friends send him, as he
simply cannot attend to such things as well as all his other work.  You should
send it to the Reviewing Com. in the U.S.A. and ask their advice.  Perhaps
an outside publisher would be interested in it?  The <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> funds have such
heavy demands made on them at present that even essential literature must
often wait to be published, unfortunately.</p>

<p n="3">He fully appreciates the fact that the believers locally, in different parts
of the world, often feel that their political party is in many ways striving to
accomplish ideals akin to our <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> aims--but the fact remains that the
only way for the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> to preserve their international character, their unity
and integrity, is for them individually to sacrifice these desired political
affiliations for the universal good and protection of the Faith.  There is no
political party in existence with whose platform we wholly agree, and we
must abstain from membership in such parties.  Likewise people who join
the Faith must have the courage and conviction to leave their political
affiliations behind.</p>

<p n="4"><pb n="254"/>There is no reason why this should cause enmity as they are not joining
another party, but a universal Faith striving for the advancement of the
entire human race.  He thinks there is very little possibility of any politician
joining the Faith.  The sacrifice of such individuals' personal ambitions is
too great a one for them to make!</p>

<p n="5">The condition of the world today is such that it is obvious no political
solution to its problems is going to be found.  We <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> must therefore
concentrate on <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> World Order--the true solution.</p>

<p n="6">He assures you he will pray your teaching labours may be very successful.
He will also pray for your dear mother's welfare.</p>

<p n="3">As regards the questions you asked:</p>

<p n="4">1. There is no significance, as far as our teachings are concerned, to "40".</p>

<p n="5">2. The "Risen Christ" is the consciousness that came to His disciples,
grieving over His death, of His living reality; it was not a physical thing but
a spiritual realization.</p>

<p n="6">3. <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> was not aware of His own station prior to His experience
in the <w type="dw">Siyah-Chal</w> of <w type="dw">Tiheran</w>.  He himself says so by implication in His Tablet
to the <w type="dw">Shah</w>.</p>

<p n="7">4. In general the administrative order as laid down in America should be
followed every where.  But secondary decisions are left to the judgement of
each National Assembly, and the American pattern, as elaborated in "<w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Procedure" need not be followed universally.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 11th, 1947, has been
received, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">The devotion and perseverance of the believers in seeking to meet the
requirements of their Plan pleases and touches him immensely, and although
he fully realizes that the fewness of their numbers and the great distances
<pb n="257"/>involved in such a vast country as Australia, form serious handicaps in the
progress of their teaching work, he, nevertheless, feels confident that they
can achieve their goals in time, and raise their heads proudly in the galaxy
of their fellow-pioneers the world over.</p>

<p n="3">We can truly say that this Cause is a cause that enables people to achieve
the impossible!  For the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,everywhere, for the most part, are people
with no great distinguishments of either wealth or fame, and yet once they
make the effort and go forth in the name of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to spread His Faith,
they become, each one, as efficacious as a host!  Witness what Mustafa
Raumie accomplished in Burma, and a handful of pioneers achieved, in a
decade, in Latin America!  It is the quality of devotion and self-sacrifice
that brings rewards in the service of this Faith rather than means, ability or
financial backing.</p>

<p n="4">This has again, during the last few years, been demonstrated even more
remarkably by the British <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,who have not only had to contend with
very limited means and a small community to draw from, but have also had
infinite restrictions and privations to put up with--and, in spite of this, they
are steadily gaining on the requirements of the Plan they have set for
themselves, and, indeed, are startling and inspiring their <w type="dw">fellow-Baha'is</w>
everywhere by their spirit and achievements!</p>

<p n="5">He hopes that now, from "down under", news will begin to flow out to
the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World of the remarkable accomplishments of the Australians
and New Zealanders!</p>

<p n="6">Regarding the question you asked him about the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> sacred writings:
these should be regarded as the writings of the <w type="dw">Bab</w>, <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>
and only these should be read during the purely devotional part of the Feast.</p>

<p n="7">He wishes to assure you, and all the other members of the N.S.A., of
his most loving and ardent prayers for the success of your various undertakings
and above all, for the success of your teaching plan.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers,</salute>
<lb/>
The Plan launched by the small yet highly promising community of devoted
believers in Australia and New Zealand constitutes a landmark of unusual
significance in the history of the evolution of the Faith in that far-off continent.  It
opens a new chapter, rich in promise, momentous in the events which it must
record, and destined to be regarded as a prelude to still more glorious chapters in
the annals of the Faith in the Antipodes.
<lb/>
The limited resources at the disposal of the prosecutors of the Plan, the vastness
of the territory in which it must operate, the fewness of the numbers of those
<pb n="258"/>participating in its execution, offer a mighty challenge which no loyal follower of
the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> can either ignore or minimize.  Indeed the greater the
challenge, the more bountiful the blessings which will be vouchsafed from on high,
and the richer the reward to be won by its triumphant executors.
<lb/>
The successful termination of this Plan, the first fruit of the newly established
and properly functioning Administrative Order in those distant lands, will pave
the way for the launching of still greater enterprises, destined to carry the message
of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to the Islands of the Pacific in the vicinity of that continent.  For the
mission entrusted to the care of the Faith in Australia and New Zealand is by no
means confined to the mainland of Australia and the islands of New Zealand, but
should embrace, as it unfolds, in the years to come, the islands of the Antipodes,
where the banner of the Faith still remains to be unfurled and its Message is as yet
undelivered.
<lb/>
It is not for them, however, at the present stage of their evolution, to probe
into the future, and seek to evaluate the range of their future achievements.  They
must concentrate every ounce of their energy, and focus their entire attention, on
the tasks immediately ahead, resolved to work unremittingly and unflinchingly
until the goals of the present Plan are achieved.
<lb/>
Whatever the situation that may develop in the years to come, however great
the obstacles by which a nascent community may yet be faced, no matter how
arduous the task now confronting its members, it must persevere until the historic
work is accomplished.
<lb/>
I will, from the depths of my heart, supplicate the Beloved to reinforce the
noble exertions of this community, guide its steps, clarify its vision, deepen its
understanding of the requirements of the present hour, and aid it to extend
continually the scope of its meritorious achievements.
<lb/>
My heart longs to receive the news of the progress of this first collective enterprise
on which the community has embarked, and I feel confident that its stalwart
members will not allow the hopes that animate me to be frustrated.

<p n="1">Your letter of May 31st took a very long time to reach our beloved
Guardian--as you can see--but it arrived at last, and he was delighted with
the news it contained.</p>

<p n="2">The fact that there are now isolated <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> and little groups forming
in different parts of New Zealand shows that at last the Faith there has
really settled down to grow, and is in the stage of definite expansion at last.</p>

<p n="3">He was very happy to hear Mr Blum had visited Australia.  This
association with the Australian believers will serve to bring closer the two
communities working under one NSA and stimulate the work in both places.</p>

<p n="4">As long as Mr Blum is so satisfactorily settled in business, a business
which enables him to travel so widely and help the friends in various cities,
he sees no urgent need for you to move away from Auckland.  But he hopes
in the future the way will open for you to do pioneer work in Wellington.</p>

<p n="5">The assistance you are giving our beloved Faith in the Antipodes is

<p n="1">Your letter to our beloved guardian, dated Dec. 8th. has been received,

<p n="2">He is delighted to hear the work is going forward in Perth, and that
Mr. Perdu<note n="90" type="foot">Joseph Perdu arrived in Australia from India about 1948.  He charmed a number
of people through posing as an inquirer who (apparently) grasped the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
teachings rapidly.  Perdu attracted many people to the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith in Australia
as well as Fiji--until his habit of borrowing money from his listeners and failing

<p n="3">Regarding your question about re-incarnation: we <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> do not believe
that one individual soul keeps returning to this earthly life in different bodies.
This is a very ancient belief, and based on a great truth--namely that the
soul does go on developing and unfolding and returning towards its Creator.
But the concept of its returning to this physical world is erroneous, and an
outgrowth of man-made doctrines which have grown up about the
fundamental concept of the progress of the soul.  It would be like putting the
child over and over again back into the world of the womb.  It is unnecessary:
but from state to state spiritually, after death, the soul does go on and go
higher, so to speak.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The letter written by our dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> brother, Mr. Jim Heggie, as
secretary at that time, and dated May 5th, as well as those written by you,
and dated July 17th, Dec. 4th, 6th (two of this date), and 9th, together with
their various enclosures, have been received, and our beloved Guardian has
instructed me to answer your Assembly on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He was very happy to hear of your meeting held in Melbourne, as he
feels sure this was a great stimulus to the local community, and he hopes
that circumstances will permit the N.S.A. to meet in other communities
and inspire and encourage the friends in different parts of the country by
this personal contact with them and their work.</p>

<p n="3">In regard to the various matters raised in your letters:</p>

<p n="4">He would be pleased to receive reports of the Teaching Work, the
Annual Convention and Annual Reports, and, of course, the minutes of
your N.S.A. meetings.</p>

<p n="5"><pb n="262"/>He does not feel it advisable to combine more than one town area in
an Assembly, as you have suggested might be done.  It is better for the friends
to move, if possible, into one town's limits, and form their Assembly that
way, or concentrate on their teaching work and wait until they have the
requisite 9 members.</p>

<p n="6">Unfortunately it is not feasible for the believers to elect or constitute
an Assembly and also elect and send delegates to the Annual Convention
of the same year, as both events take place in the <w type="dw">Ridvan</w> period.</p>

<p n="7">The Guardian is striving to build up uniformity in essentials all over
the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World, and this frequently involves a small measure of delay in
achieving our various goals set locally.  But he considers it sufficiently
important to warrant the sacrifices it sometimes involves:</p>

<p n="8">In this connection he would like to mention your Local <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>: He
feels that they should conform much more closely to the original one of the
New York Assembly.  What is absolutely <emph rend="italics">essential</emph> was incorporated in those,
and all other Local Assemblies being incorporated should follow this pattern
as closely as local legal technicalities permit.  This again is in order to maintain
international uniformity in essentials.  It is not a question here of whether
the <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> drawn up by your Legal Committee are not more up to date
and do not represent the last word, undoubtedly they are and do, but if
every country, when drawing up its Local <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>, continues this process of
elaboration, in the end uniformity will be lost.  The Eastern Assemblies have
adhered to the original <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> so carefully that they have practically
translated them word for word and adopted them.  He feels sure Mr. Dive
will understand this, and he would like you to please express to him his
deep appreciation of the excellent work he has done in this connection,
truly a labour of love to the Faith.</p>

<p n="9">There is also another, perhaps even more pertinent reason, why he
does not want anything more added to these New York <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>, and that is
that he is everywhere urging the believers--the Americans included--to not
add <emph rend="underscore">procedures</emph> and <emph rend="underscore">rulings</emph> to the Cause.  He considers that what he has laid
down in <bibl><title><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administration</title></bibl> is essential, but that practically everything
else is secondary and he wishes the Assemblies, your own included, to deal
with things with elasticity, as they come up, case by case, and not by
continually passing new rulings to cover all similar cases.</p>

<p n="10">The efforts being made by your Assembly to carry out the Teaching
Plan for Australia and New Zealand, and the ever-increasing response of
the believers in both places to this all-important work, greatly encourage
and cheer him.  He feels sure a very great future lies in store for our beloved
Faith in those distant regions, but much more still remains to be done by
the friends in order to complete this first, historic and vital, organized Plan
<pb n="263"/>of theirs.  He feels sure they will see it through to victory; just as their brothers
and sisters in other lands, working also on Plans of their own, are determined
to achieve all their goals at the appointed time, so must they persevere and
ensure a resounding victory for the Faith there in the Antipodes.</p>

<p n="11">His loving prayers are offered in the Holy Shrines very often for the
success of your work, and that God may bless you and all the members of
the National Assembly in the discharge of your important duties.</p>

P.S.  I wish to also acknowledge receipt of the letter of your Assembly's
Treasurer, dated Dec. 23rd, and to thank you, on behalf of the Guardian, for
your loving contribution to the International Fund here in Haifa.  He regrets
the delay in getting this off to you, but has been too busy to attend to it
owing to work in connection with the Shrine here.  Kindly give the enclosed
receipt to Mr. Tunks.
<lb/>
[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
Recent communications and reports from your Assembly have revealed, in a
very striking manner, the magnificent progress achieved by the alert, the faithful,
and truly distinguished communities of the followers of the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in
Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania.  The range of their labours, the rapid
consolidation of their swiftly multiplying institutions, the soundness and solidity of
the foundations, on which they are erecting these institutions, the exemplary loyalty
they demonstrate, the solidarity and self-sacrifice, the courage and confidence
they display in their incessant and manifold activities, prove, beyond the shadow
of a doubt that the Faith they love and serve so nobly and efficiently has at last
been firmly and unassailably established in the Antipodes, and that its upholders
and defenders in those far-away yet highly promising islands are contributing a
notable and never-to-be-forgotten share to the onward march and unfoldment of
its world Administrative Order.
<lb/>
I desire to offer the members of this high-minded, this resolute and dearly-beloved
community, and particularly its elected representatives, my heartfelt
congratulations on their splendid achievements which posterity will recognize as
deeds that have truly enriched and adorned the annals of the Faith in the opening
years of the second <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> century.
<lb/>
As the processes impelling a rapidly evolving Order on the highroad of its
destiny multiply and gather momentum, attention should be increasingly directed
to the vital need of ensuring, by every means possible, the deepening of the Faith,
the understanding and the spiritual life of the individuals who, as the privileged
members of this community, are called upon to participate in this glorious
unfoldment, and are lending their assistance to this historic evolution.  A profound
study of the Faith which they have espoused, its history, its spiritual as well as
<pb n="264"/>administrative principles; a thorough understanding of the Covenant of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>
and of the Will of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, a deeper realization of the implications of the
claims advanced by the Founders of the Faith; strict adherence to the laws and
principles which they have established; a greater dedication to the fundamentals
and verities enshrined in their teachings--these constitute, I feel convinced, the
urgent need of the members of this rapidly expanding community.  For upon this
spiritual foundation must depend the solidity of the institutions which they are now
so painstakingly erecting.  Every outward thrust into new fields, every multiplication
of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> institutions, must be paralleled by a deeper thrust of the roots which
sustain the spiritual life of the community and ensure its sound development.  From
this vital, this ever-present need, attention must at no time be diverted; nor must
it be, under any circumstances, neglected, or subordinated to the no less vital and
urgent task of ensuring the outer expansion of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> administrative institutions.
That this community, so alive, so devoted, so strikingly and rapidly developing,
may maintain a proper balance between these two essential aspects of its
development, and march forward with rapid strides and along sound lines toward
the goal of the Plan it has adopted, is the ardent hope of my heart and my constant
prayer.

<p n="1">Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Jan. 1st, has been received,

<p n="2">He is very pleased over the prospect of your being able, during this
year's "rest" to render very valuable and <emph rend="underscore">much</emph> needed services in the teaching
field.  As he already stated in his answer to your cable, which he hopes reached
you via Australia, he is anxious for you to help the British Teaching Plan all
you can.</p>

<p n="3">In addition to this he feels that your attendance, at the next European
Teaching Conference, would be of great inspiration to you, and also enable
you to visit some of the continental centers and help the new Assemblies
and pioneers.</p>

<p n="4">On your way home--if, as you say, your ambitious and highly meritorious
plan works out!--he would be particularly pleased if you could see the Sofia
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w> and those in Turkey.  Beloved Marion Jack would be so grateful for
even a glimpse of a believer from outside, after all these heroic years alone
there, (she is now about 80!) and the friends in Turkey are now active and
longing for help.  Enclosed you will find their addresses.</p>

<p n="5">He wishes you every success and great happiness in this service you are
about to undertake, and his loving prayers support you, you may be sure.</p>

<p n="1">Your letters dated February 23; March 14, 16; April 4,5,11; May 2, 13,
27, June 1, 7, 21 (3 of this date), 24; have all been received, as well as their
enclosures, and the material sent under separate cover, and our beloved
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He has gone over the copy of the <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> of a Local Assembly which
you sent him, and he approves of the slight changes you have made in the
wording, as well as the additions at the very beginning, providing you
consider the addition essential in order to secure the government recognition
you are going to seek in the future.  However, he feels that Article VI is not
correct in the form you have given it, because you state "all persons
resident ... who have attained the age of 15 years".  The original New York
<bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> are more correct, because they differentiate clearly between all
members of the community and voting members who are 21 years of age or
more.  In other words children under 15 years are <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> according to the
New York version, which is correct, but according to your version only people
over 15 years are <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> which is not correct.  He thinks you should go
back to the New York version.  The declaration of faith by children when
they reach the age of 15 in the United States is in order to enable the
American Youth to apply for exemption, under the American laws, from
active military service.  It has no other purpose, but in that country is
<pb n="269"/>expedient.  It is not necessary to add such a clause to your <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>.</p>

<p n="3">Other points which he feels are not necessary and should be deleted
are those heavily underlined portions in <bibl><biblScope type="part">Section 5 of Article XII and Article
XIII</biblScope></bibl>.  In both these cases the <bibl><title>New York By-Laws</title></bibl> should be followed and not
added to.  Likewise he feels that in <bibl><biblScope type="part">Article XIV</biblScope></bibl>, under the heading "These
<bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> (on page 11) B and C should be deleted as they are not in the New
York original and not necessary.  Naturally, all Assemblies are under N.S.A.
jurisdiction, but this need not be included.</p>

<p n="4">He wishes the essentials to be maintained as per the <bibl><title>New York By-Laws</title></bibl>,
but not amplified and added to, as this will gradually lead, all over the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world, to a steady addition of unessential rules and restrict the freedom
and plasticity of the Cause.  As he has repeatedly told the American and
other National Assemblies, it is much better to deal with situations and
new requirements as they arise, and not to have it all down in black and
white and rigid before hand.</p>

<p n="5">He is very happy to see you are steadily working towards the goal of
having Local Assemblies empowered to hold property legally and to perform
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> marriages.  No doubt the act of the Canadian Parliament recently
passed, and giving the Canadian N.S.A. legal status will act as an important
precedent when the time is ripe for you to present your own petitions to
your Government.</p>

<p n="6">The news that there is now a Spiritual Assembly in every capital city
of the various states in Australia pleased him immensely.  This is an historic
landmark in your progress out there, and must act as a keen incentive to
further exploits on the part of the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="7">He was also delighted to see that certain of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> have received
official permission not to work on <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Holy Days.  He admires the
initiative these believers have shown, and hopes many others will follow
their example.</p>

<p n="8">Likewise, he was very pleased to see you are holding your N.S.A.
meetings in various centres, as this will greatly stimulate the local work,
draw the friends closer to your body, and promote unity and enthusiasm
amongst them.</p>

<p n="9">The Act of your Assembly of depriving Mr. Austin of his voting rights
was wise and correct.  Unless he demonstrates an entire change of character
he certainly cannot claim to be a member of any <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community.</p>

<p n="10">He appreciated the Secretary's forwarding to him copies of the Bishop's
letters acknowledging receipt of <bibl><title>God Passes By</title></bibl>--though their answers in
no way imply any spiritual wakefulness on their parts, alas!</p>

<p n="11">He was very happy to see that New Zealand friends were present at the
Convention.  In general the work in New Zealand is certainly progressing,
and beginning to show really promising signs for the immediate future.</p>

<p n="12"><pb n="270"/>The generous donation of land to Yerrinbool School by Mr. Styles<note n="91" type="foot">Albert Styles was introduced to the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith by Stanley and Mariette Bolton.
He declared in Sydney in 1945, before moving to Yerrinbool two years later.  In
1961 he became the first caretaker at Sydney <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w>, but died the
following year.</note>
will certainly re-enforce that valuable <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> property, and the Guardian
very much appreciated this act of his.</p>

<p n="13">His confidence in, and admiration for, the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and
New Zealand is steadily increasing, as he witnesses the enthusiasm and self-confidence
of the believers out there, and the increased capacity of their
National Body to handle wisely and capably the affairs of the Cause.</p>

<p n="14">He assures you all, and through you the believers, of his loving prayers
for your success and the attainment of all the goals of your historic Plan.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The notable progress achieved in recent months, in so many fields and in spite
of adverse circumstances, demonstrates afresh the vitality of the faith and the
soundness of the outlook, of the members of the fast-advancing and steadily
consolidating community of the followers of the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in Australia,
New Zealand and Tasmania.  This remarkable process of expansion and
consolidation augurs well for the ultimate success of the Plan to which the combined
resources of this community are committed.  The various reports, both local and
national which I have perused with sustained interest and quickened admiration,
attest the rapid and sound development, of the institutions of a Faith that is so rich
in promise, and whose interests are being promoted with such devotion, energy,
loyalty and consecration by the members of this community.
<lb/>
What has been achieved, in both the teaching field and in the administrative
sphere of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> service, however is but a stepping stone to the still greater victories
which the gradual unfoldment of the Plan must inevitably produce.  The
multiplication of the groups and Assemblies that constitute the bedrock of the Faith,
must accompany the consolidating process which must bring in its wake, on the
one hand, the incorporation of these Assemblies and their recognition by the civil
authorities, and the establishment, on the other, of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> local endowments and
the right of these Assemblies to execute, officially, the fundamental laws of the
Most Holy Book regarding both marriage and divorce that constitute the
distinguishing feature of this most holy and august Dispensation.
<lb/>
The task undertaken is immense, fraught with momentous possibilities, highly
delicate in nature, and bound to have far-reaching repercussions, not only in the
West, and particularly in the continent of Europe, where the institutions of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Administrative Order are emerging with such rapidity and showing
<pb n="271"/>such promise, but on the continent of Asia, where the overwhelming majority of
the followers of the Most Great Name, have endured such grievous afflictions,
and are faced with grave peril, and are battling so heroically against the forces of
darkness with which they are encompassed.
<lb/>
The nature of the work in which this wide-awake, untrammelled unprejudiced,
freedom-loving community, is so energetically engaged, cannot, therefore, be
regarded as a purely local and isolated enterprise, but is vitally linked with the
fortunes of a world-encircling Order, functioning mysteriously in both the Eastern
and Western Hemispheres, highly organized in its administrative machinery,
sensitive in its features, revolutionizing in its implications, and destined to seek
increasingly, as it expands and develops, the good-will and assistance of the civil
authorities in every continent of the globe.
<lb/>
The number of pioneers, both from among the veterans of the Faith who have
participated in the early establishment of this infant Order in the Antipodes, and
the new believers who have embraced its Cause, must, if this task is to be successfully
carried out, be substantially increased.  The flow of funds to both the local and
national treasuries must correspondingly be augmented and systematically
sustained.  The heroism and self-sacrifice of those who prosecute the Plan, both as
administrators and pioneers, must attain greater heights and engender still more
powerful forces in the spiritual life of this community.
<lb/>
The relationship binding it to the civil authorities of the Australian
Commonwealth, the Dominion of New Zealand and the Island of Tasmania,
must be assiduously fostered.  The ties linking it with the members of the world-wide
community of the adherents of the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, must be rapidly
strengthened and multiplied.  The unity and solidarity of its constituent members
must be simultaneously reinforced, its roots permanently planted in the soil of the
Covenants of both <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, its branches spread out irresistibly
to the furthest ends of that far-off continent, its vision clarified, its determination
reaffirmed and its consecration deepened.
<lb/>
Obstacles, varied and numerous, will no doubt arise to impede the onward
march of this community.  Reverses may temporarily dim the radiance of its mission.
The forces of religious orthodoxy may well, at a future date, be leagued against it.
The exponents of theories and doctrines fundamentally opposed to its religious
tenets and social principles may challenge its infant strength with persistence and
severity.  The Administrative Order--the Ark destined to preserve its integrity and
carry it to safety--must without delay, without exception, claim the attention of
the members of this community, its ideals must be continually cherished in their
hearts, its purposes studied and kept constantly before their eyes, its requirements
wholeheartedly met, its laws scrupulously upheld, its institutions unstintingly
supported, its glorious mission noised abroad, and its spirit made the sole motivating
purpose of their lives.
<lb/>
Then and only then, will this community, so young, so vibrant with life, so
<pb n="272"/>rich in promise, so dedicated to its task, be in a position to discharge adequately its
weighty responsibilities, to reap the full harvest it has sown, acquire still greater
potentialities for the conduct of subsequent stages in the crusade on which it has
embarked, and contribute, to a degree unsuspected as yet by its members, its full
share to the World-wide establishment of the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, the emancipation
of its Oriental followers, the recognition of its independence, the birth of its World
Order and the emergence of that world civilisation which that Order is destined to
create.

<salute>The Spiritual Assembly of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Adelaide, Australia.
<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter, dated June 3, with attached correspondence, was received
by the beloved Guardian, forwarded by the N.S.A., and he has instructed
me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He has written to the National Assembly about the whole matter of
the local <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> and approved of some of their changes of the original
New York <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> and instructed them not to change other portions; so
he feels now the whole matter is clarified and the N.S.A. can go ahead on
the instructions they have received from him.</p>

<p n="3">Naturally, we all realize that all Local Assemblies are under the
jurisdiction of their National Assembly, just as at present all National
Assemblies are watched over and instructed by the Guardian.  The Local
Assembly cannot disregard its National Body, but has the right to appeal, as
you have done, and to carry the matter to Shoghi Effendi himself.</p>

<p n="4">The general principle has always been to encourage Local Assemblies
to incorporate, but they do this with the knowledge of their N.S.A. so as to
ensure uniformity, and also so that weak Assemblies will not prematurely
incorporate &amp; perhaps later be forced to dissolve.  So your Assembly, by
incorporating was certainly following the Guardian's advice.</p>

<p n="5">Now, however, that he has given full instructions to the N.S.A., he
feels you must co-operate in every way with that Body, in order to hasten
the day when the Government will grant incorporation nationally and
locally.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter dated September 23 has been received, with its enclosures,
and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He is sorry to hear you resigned from your Local Assembly as he feels
that in spite of how much an individual may suffer over conditions he feels
are not as they should be, he should nevertheless stick it out for the sake of
serving the Cause, and showing a firm example of endurance and willingness
to serve to the newer believers.  He knows this requires courage and self-sacrifice,
but he feels you are capable of both.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian was not satisfied with some of the changes made in the
<bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>, and he wrote (recently) the N.S.A. and in detail pointed out what
could be changed and what was too great a departure from the original
model.  He feels, therefore, that you and other friends who were justifiably
disturbed about this matter, can now rest assured that the matter is clarified
and the necessary action has been taken.</p>

<p n="4">The difficulties, and the evidences of immaturity, which you mention
in your letter are not confined to Australia.  They seem to be an inevitable
phase in the growth of our Administration, which is so much more perfect
than the believers called upon to create it!  There are bound to be many
misunderstandings, and some small abuses, in erecting a system which is so
different from the ways men are used to.  But we must not attach undue
importance to these things, but look upon them as a mother looks upon the
<pb n="275"/>mistakes of her children, realizing that with maturity will come the capacity
to handle situations better and with more sound judgement.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian has encouraged the breaking up of large communities,
wherever possible, in order to form more Assemblies.  This process produces
at first a weakening effect, naturally, on the larger communities; but it is
essential and the results will soon be seen to offset the disadvantages.</p>

<p n="6">He urges you to continue your devoted services to the Cause, with a
mind at rest, confident that those conditions which distress you so much
are only a phase and will soon pass away.</p>

<p n="2">First, let me say how very deeply he appreciates the services you have

the past two years.  Your trip has been of real assistance to the teaching
work, and it pleased him greatly.</p>

<p n="3">Regarding Mr. Perdu: it was with the approval of the Guardian that his
name was removed from the voting list.  It is very bad for the Cause to have
a member of the Community, <emph rend="underscore">actively</emph>, in the public eye, teaching the Faith,
and at the same time showing dishonest characteristics.  We cannot possibly
say that because a person also has many virtues, faults as grave as lying and
dishonourable conduct regarding money, can be overlooked!  This means
that we tolerate as representatives of our Faith people who flagrantly disobey
its laws and fundamental teachings.  This does not mean there is no hope for
Mr. Perdu; let him change his conduct, if he really loves the Cause, and
then a way will be opened for him to again be active.  But the change must

<salute>Spiritual Assembly of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Adelaide.
<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter of December 14 has been received, as well as its enclosures,
and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He sympathises with you in your feeling of distress about the immediate
consequences which will follow upon carrying out the instructions of your
N.S.A. regarding the formation of groups in the various municipalities about
Adelaide proper.  However, he feels that your feelings are largely caused by
a certain degree of confusion in your minds about the administration.</p>

<p n="3">In the United States this principle has already been put into effect
some years ago, namely that a Spiritual Assembly should be constituted by
voting believers resident within the civic limits of any given place.  At first
this change-over caused difficulties and confusion in many centres,
particularly large and old ones, like your own there in Adelaide, but it greatly
<pb n="278"/>strengthened the Cause, put the administration on a firm and logical
foundation from a legal point of view as well as an administrative one,
increased not only the number of Assemblies but also the number of groups,
and gave more believers a chance to function actively.</p>

<p n="4">The time has now come when the same thing can and must be done in
Australia.  Your Assembly and Community should look upon this as a
challenge and an opportunity to assist the Faith to expand, not only locally
but nationally.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian does not consider that local difficulties, such as tram
lines, etc, can be allowed to stand in the way of a national policy, which is
what this change is--a new national policy given your N.S.A. by the Guardian
himself.</p>

<p n="6">Because of the national character of the change involved there was no
necessity for your N.S.A. to consult any Local Assembly.  It is the right and
duty of the N.S.A. to manage the national affairs of the community at large.</p>

<p n="7">Likewise, he does not feel that any of your community members should
feel they are having their vote taken from them.  If they moved away and
became isolated believers, under normal circumstances, they would lose their
vote.  In future, when your country passes through this transitional period,
and you have believers spread more evenly over your states, the state will be
the unit, not the Assembly (which is now the case in America), and then
every <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> isolated or otherwise, will have a vote.</p>

<p n="8">It will be seen, therefore, that the sooner Adelaide puts into operation
the plan outlined for them by their N.S.A., the sooner will this period of
transition be passed.  Also, it will hasten the day when all Local Assemblies
can be incorporated and receive recognised status, along with their N.S.A.,
from the government.</p>

<p n="9">Judging from the many letters he has received from Australia dealing
with administrative details, he feels the friends there are attaching too much
importance to it.  Administration is to <emph rend="underscore">facilitate</emph> teaching work primarily.  It
is not something to be over-elaborated and become a source of dissension
amongst the believers.</p>

<p n="10">He hopes, now that he has frankly pointed out to you what must be
done, you will do it not only with minds at rest as to the wisdom of the
N.S.A.'s plan, but also with hearts thrilled by the challenge of this
opportunity--for it is an opportunity--to build up new Assemblies, new
groups, and give more of your Adelaide members a chance to become active
in both the teaching work and on the future Assemblies.</p>

<closer>
<salute>With warmest greetings,</salute>
<signed>R. Rabbani.</signed>
<lb/>
P.S.  He feels he should call your attention to the fact that this separation
does not mean none of the believers residing in greater Adelaide cannot
<pb n="279"/>hold, for instance, joint anniversaries or Holy Days together, or Feasts, or
public meetings.  It is the general principle of an Assembly within a civil
area which is involved.

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letters, dated 18 and 20 October, 1949 were received by our
beloved Guardian, as well as the manuscript you forwarded him separately.</p>

<p n="2">He invariably refuses to go over any manuscripts sent him by the friends,
as he has no time to do so at all.  He regrets this necessity to refuse your
request, but feels sure you will understand it is in no way personal.  It was
very nice of you to send the dedication to him; he appreciated this very
much.</p>

<p n="3">He will now give you his sincere advice regarding Theosophy: this
<pb n="283"/>teaching has done much for you and you owe it much; you might have
never been receptive to the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith if Theosophy had not stirred up
your mind to thinking along new lines.  But when a child is born, out of
mistaken loyalty it must not seek to cling to the womb.  The new life is fuller
and better.  It can be grateful to the womb.  So you, now born into the fuller
Light of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> teachings, should not cling to Theosophy any longer.
You are, naturally, entirely free in this matter.  But before deciding for yourself
what course you wish to pursue--to be a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> or a theosophist--he advises
you to pray about the matters troubling you and meditate on them.  What
the Master says about re-incarnation we <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> must accept as true; the
proofs and evidence to the contrary are subject to other interpretations than
that of re-incarnation.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian will pray for your guidance and your progress in
understanding.</p>

<salute>Mr H. Fitzner,<note n="95" type="foot">Knights of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to Portuguese Timor Harold (d.1969) and Florence Fitzner
(d.1980) first met Hyde and Clara Dunn in Adelaide in 1927.  Harold, then
Chief clerk at North British Insurance Company, was elected to Adelaide
Assembly from 1930 to 1950.  The couple married on 14 May, 1931.  That year
they helped plan Mrs Keith Ransom-Kehler's visit to Adelaide.  Both served on
the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl> Committee; for many years Harold was responsible for
the magazine's production and despatch.  Florence served on the Local Spiritual
Assembly from 1929 into the late 1930s; she assisted, in addition, with its
children's classes and its community program of visiting the sick and the elderly.
Frequently Florence and Harold drove to small country towns--such as Port
Pirie, Kingston, Kapunda and Nuriootpa--on weekends, to make friends whereever
possible, or to find a venue at which to give a public meeting.  Harold
served on the National Spiritual Assembly 1943 -- 45 and 1947 -- 48.  With the
announcement of the goals of the World Crusade the Fitzners resolved to move
to Portuguese Timor.  The acquisition of visas after persistent efforts was
remarkable, since only Portuguese citizens were eligible.  Harold arrived in Dili
in June 1954, and Florence followed in October.  Several Local Assemblies were
formed before Harold's death in 1968.  Florence remained until 1975, when
Indonesian annexation of the former colony, at a time when she was visiting
Adelaide, prevented her return.</note> sec.

<p n="1">Because our beloved Guardian has delayed so long in answering your
letters (dated May 18, July 17, and November 8, 1949, and January 2, 1950)
you must not think he did not appreciate receiving them.  On the contrary,
he was delighted to hear of all you could accomplish on the Continent and
with the British Plan, and as he was in cable communication with you, he
let your letters wait while he attended to more urgent ones.  He is often
forced to do this, but feels sure the friends understand the reason for delay.</p>

<p n="2">Your extended visit has been of great help to the friends in many places.
It was much more important for you to do what you did than to go back via
Persia and India, and have so little time en route to see the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="3">It seems as if temporarily at least we must resign ourselves to the fact
that people of real prominence in the world are too ambitious, too timid or
too spiritually weak, to embrace the Faith and stand up for it.  However,
contacts such as that you made with Countess Gowrie are very worth while.
They serve to make us known in higher circles and to create a favourable
opinion of us.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian is sorry you should have been so near--in the Suez Canal
--and yet not able to come here.  But as he has not made any exceptions he
did not feel it would be fair to let you come when others, who have never
seen Haifa, have been refused.  No doubt in the future the way will open.</p>

<p n="5">He will particularly pray that your health may improve, and deeply
values your devoted services and your love for the Cause.</p>

<lb/>
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letters of August 9, 19; September 14, 22; November 7, 10, 21; of
1949; January 19; February 28; March 8, 31; April 11; May 2 (two), 1950,
have been received by our beloved Guardian and he has instructed me to
answer them on his behalf.  The many enclosures and material forwarded
have, likewise, been safely received.</p>

<p n="2">It has been impossible for our Guardian to keep abreast of his
correspondence and other work this Winter and Spring.  It is only during
the last week that he has been able to turn to the mountain of mail,
<pb n="286"/>representing the correspondence of the various National Assemblies, and
commence replying.  The reason for this regrettable delay is that in order to
get the arcade of the Shrine of the <w type="dw">Bab</w> finished in time for the centenary of
His Martyrdom he had to undertake extensive excavations into the solid
rock of the mountain behind the Shrine--the new edifice being much larger
than the precious original building it is designed to enshrine and protect.
This work he personally supervised in order to ensure the Shrine was in no
way damaged, and to see the cost was kept within bounds.  You can imagine
this was a very exacting and tiring ordeal for him.</p>

<p n="3">Then, just as he had hoped to take up his overburdening
correspondence, Mr. Maxwell, the architect of the Shrine, at the beginning
of April became desperately ill, and for ten weeks absorbed the anxious care
and attention of us all, as his condition was seemingly hopeless.  Thanks to
the Mercy of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and the determination of the Guardian, he is
recovering and our lives are getting back to normal routine.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian regrets very much the conduct of Mr Perdu; it seems
now fairly clear that he is a former <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> from India who misconducted
himself there over a period of years and then showed up, under a different
name, in Australia.  No one who conducts himself as he has can remain a
voting member of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community for--in spite of his wide knowledge
of the Faith and his belief in it--his acts are contrary to its teachings and
bring not only confusion into the Community and create inharmony, but
disgrace the Cause in the eyes of <w type="dw">non-Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian fully realizes that the process of splitting up large
communities into smaller ones, each existing within its own civil units, has
been difficult for the Australian friends.  What they do not seem to fully
appreciate is that this has been done in Canada and the United States as
well, and is only in order to organize the Assemblies on a logical basis, and
one with a firmer legal foundation.  The fact that this may create more
Assemblies in the end, and that it sometimes breaks up existing ones, is
only incidental; the important point is to consolidate the communities on a
sound basis, i.e. every Assembly within the limits of the Municipality its
members reside in.</p>

<p n="6">As Mrs Axford requested Mrs Thomas to write about her <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> life
there is every reason to respect her wishes.  This in no way precludes the
New Zealand Community from writing about her services and life and
keeping this record in the National archives.  The Guardian feels the
Auckland Assembly should be consulted, as her, (Mrs Axford's), home
community, by Mrs Thomas.  He hopes this In Memoriam article, about so
dear and tireless a servant of the Faith, will produce a spirit of love and co-operation
amongst all concerned.</p>

<p n="7"><pb n="287"/>The gift by Miss Perks of an additional piece of land to the Yerrinbool
School is deeply appreciated.  It enriches the endowments already held by
your Assembly.  Please thank Miss Perks, on behalf of the Guardian, for this
generous contribution, to the institutions of the Faith in Australia, and tell
her he does not feel any name should be given the property other than of
Yerrinbool School, of which it will form a part, and that she will always be
remembered as the donor of it.</p>

<p n="8">The acquisition of the site for the New Zealand Summer School was a
great step forward in the progress of the Faith there, and he was very pleased
about it.  He was also delighted to hear of the formation of the Devonport
Assembly, and he hopes next year there will be still more.</p>

<p n="9">I would also like to answer here a question raised in Mrs Bolton's letter
of March 8: the Guardian feels that no annual fixed pilgrimage should be
made to the grave of Father Dunn.  The friends will naturally always want to
go there, when and how they like, but it must not become a ceremony,
otherwise it will constitute a precedent for similar things in the future.</p>

<p n="10">It is premature, and will weaken the national and local work, for
delegates to be elected by State elections rather than by Assemblies.  There
is no question involved about believers losing their voting rights: all the
time believers are gaining and losing their voting rights by becoming
members of communities with Assemblies or moving out into places where
they are isolated believers.  The friends should not dwell on these minor
details, but concentrate on teaching the Cause and exemplifying the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
life.  Voting is a purely administrative detail, but teaching and serving are
vital spiritual obligations.  Regarding the change of the <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>: the
Guardian considers the letter he wrote you about this subject is final.  He is
considerably surprised by the fact that of all the National Bodies in the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World, operating under these <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl>, it is only the Assembly of
Australia and New Zealand, evidently acting under pressure from their legal
committee, that constantly raises the question of changing them.  This he
considers is going too far, and is not necessary.  He holds very bright hopes
for the future of your work, and urges you, and through you all the believers,
to concentrate on your glorious teaching tasks and forge ahead to win new
victories for the beloved Faith.</p>

<pb n="288"/>[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The remarkable progress achieved by the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities in Australia,
New Zealand and Tasmania in promoting the Plan, designed to further the interests
of the Faith in the Antipodes, is most encouraging, and will, when consummated,
mark the opening of a new and glorious chapter in the history of the Faith in that
continent.  The varied and welcome evidences of the steady extension in the range
of the manifold activities of these communities, the multiplication of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
institutions and their rapid consolidation, are particularly gratifying and merit the
highest praise.
<lb/>
The territories in which these communities conduct their meritorious, strenuous
and highly promising activities with such diligence, resolution, fidelity and devotion,
are admittedly vast and constitute a direct challenge to those who are called upon
to diffuse the light of the Faith, and lay an unassailable foundation for its rising
Administrative Order, throughout the length and breadth of these territories.
<lb/>
The Plan, now operating with increasing momentum in that far-off continent,
is designed to enable its prosecutors to lay the first foundations of the structure
which the members of these communities must rear in the years to come.  As these
primary pillars of a divinely ordained steadily evolving, spiritually propelled order
are successively erected and sufficiently consolidated, and the agencies designed
for the launching of a systematic campaign aiming at the future proclamation of
the Faith to the masses inhabiting these far-flung territories multiply, a simultaneous
effort should be exerted, and measures should be carefully devised, by the national
elected representatives of these same communities, for the launching of the initial
enterprises destined to carry the Message of the Faith, beyond the confines of these
territories, to the Islands of the Pacific, lying in their immediate neighbourhood.
<lb/>
For whatever may be the nature of the future successive crusades which the
American and Canadian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities, may, under the Divine Plan of
<w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, launch in the course of the opening decades of the second <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
century, and however extensive the range of their operations, and no matter how
far-reaching the future campaigns which the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community, centred in the
heart of the British Isles, may undertake throughout the widely-scattered
dependencies of the British Crown, the responsibility devolving upon the National
elected representatives of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of the Australasian continent for the
introduction of the Faith and its initial establishment in the Islands of the Pacific,
linking them, on the one hand, with their sister communities in the American
continents and on the other hand, with the communities in South-Eastern Asia,
remains clear and inescapable.
<lb/>
As the various <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> national communities, labouring directly as well as
indirectly, under the impulse of a Divine Plan, broaden and consolidate the base
of their operations in their respective homelands, and acquire the potentialities that
will empower them to lend, in an ever-increasing measure, their share, and
participate in the world-wide propagation of the Faith, the Australian and New
<pb n="289"/>Zealand believers must, for their part, contribute worthily to the overseas teaching
activities and accomplishments of these communities.  Already the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
community in the Great Republic of the West, the vanguard of the irresistibly
marching army of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, has launched its twin crusades in Latin America
and the continent of Europe.  Its collaborator in the execution of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w>
Divine Plan, the Canadian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community is busily engaged in establishing the
Faith beyond the Canadian mainland and further north in the vast territory of
Greenland.  The Persian and <w type="dw">Iraqi</w> <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities are, moreover, assiduously
labouring in the adjacent territories of the Arabian Peninsula and the Kingdom of
Afghanistan, while their sister-communities in the sub-continent of India are pushing
the frontiers of the Faith as far as Ceylon in the South and Siam and Indonesia to
the North and Southeast of that subcontinent.  More recently the members of the
British <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community, having brought to a successful conclusion their first
historic Plan, are devising the necessary measures for the launching of a teaching
enterprise in the heart of Africa, supplementing the work already accomplished by
the Egyptian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community in that continent.  Shortly, and at its appointed
time, yet another national community, already established in the heart of the
European continent, will, as soon as the present obstacles are removed, and its
internal activities are sufficiently consolidated, embark on a campaign, beyond the
borders of its homeland, that will carry the light of the Faith to the adjoining Balkan
territories, the Baltic states and, across the eastern frontiers of Europe, into Asia.
In this stupendous and laudable collective enterprise, world-wide in its range,
divinely propelled, world-redemptive in its purpose, in which National <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities, already sufficiently consolidated from within, are participating, each
in accordance with the provisions of its own specific plan and constituting, in its
proportions and potentialities, the mightiest spiritual crusade launched since the
inception of the Formative Age of the Faith,--in such an enterprise the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities of Australia and New Zealand can neither afford to remain inactive
or play a negligible part.  The situation they occupy, the unnumbered virgin
territories lying in their neighbourhood, the vitality and adventurous spirit the
members of these communities have so strikingly manifested--all demand that they
arise, as soon as the process of internal consolidation is sufficiently advanced, to
play their part in this world-encompassing crusade now unfolding itself in, and
constituting the brightest feature of, the opening years of the second <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> century.
With this glorious vision before them, assured that a full measure of Divine
guidance and sustenance will be vouchsafed to them when they embark on the
second stage of their collective activities, let them concentrate, in the years
immediately ahead, on the tasks that require their earnest and undivided attention.
The prosecution of the Plan, in all its aspects, is their primary obligation.  Whatever
contributes to the broadening and reinforcement of the Administrative Base,
designed to guide, coordinate and extend the ramifications of their future enterprises
overseas, should be unhesitatingly welcomed and carried out at the present hour
<pb n="290"/>and during the opening phase of their collective unified endeavour in the service of
the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.
<lb/>
May they seize every opportunity that presents itself, surmount every obstacle
that may confront them in the future, and pave the way for a befitting inauguration
of the subsequent phase of their historic and rapidly unfolding mission.

<p n="1">Your letter dated June 1st was received, together with the reports &amp;
clippings you were kind enough to send, and the Guardian would have replied
to you sooner had he not been so busy and over worked.</p>

<p n="2">He was very pleased to see you had been able to make such an extensive
and useful teaching trip.</p>

<p n="3">It is always most difficult to open people's eyes to their own short-comings,
and to pray for them, and encourage other members of the
Community to do their share of the work, seems the best way to modify the
influence of domineering characters.  So often such people are immature
and do not mean to do any harm at all.</p>

<p n="4">He was pleased to see you regard not being re-elected to the N.S.A. as
a God-sent opportunity to do more teaching.  It is very unfortunate, but often
the friends consider administrative positions something to be coveted,
whereas in reality they are a burdensome responsibility, and teaching is the
greatest joy and blessing a believer can have.  He hopes you will be able to
devote yourself more and more to this field of service.</p>

<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letters addressed to our beloved Guardian, and dated June 22,
August 4 and 22, November 10 and December 5 and 11, of 1950 and January
30 and Feb. 20, 22, 26, of 1951, together with their enclosures, have been
received; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2"><pb n="298"/>In regard to the various matters raised in your letters:</p>

<p n="3">It is indeed a great tragedy that Mr. Perdu should have such an utterly
despicable character, and the ability to be a teacher.  He has undoubtedly
dealt with the greatest injustice with the friends in Fiji who wrote to Mr.
Blum; and the Guardian was extremely sorry to hear that this man, attracted
to the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and evidently a sincere and decent person, should
have been duped by the very man who gave him this glorious Message.  It
was very wise to send Mr. Blum out there; and he hopes that your Assembly
will keep in close contact with the friends who were attracted, it would
seem almost miraculously under the circumstances, to the Cause of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in those distant islands.</p>

<p n="4">It might interest your Assembly to know that since leaving Fiji, Mr
Perdu went to the United States, and himself admitted in a letter to the
Guardian that he had seen Ahmad Sohrab.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian assures your Assembly, and, through you, all the believers
throughout Australasia, that he has been deeply touched by the spirit of
loyalty which you have all shown at this difficult time for him, and also the
devotion to every work which is undertaken here at the International Centre
of the Faith.</p>

<p n="6">The support you have given to the construction of the Shrine of the
<w type="dw">Bab</w> has been deeply appreciated; and he hopes that in the not distant future
it will be possible for the doors of pilgrimage to be opened once more; and
then the believers can see with their own eyes what their sacrificial
contributions have helped to erect, on Mount Carmel.  It will interest the
friends to hear that we are at present busy with the preliminary work required
prior to the erection of the second story of the Holy Tomb, in other words,
the octagonal portion, which will be built on atop of the roof of the original
Shrine building erected by <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> Himself.  The stones have been
ordered from Italy for this next stage in our undertaking, and soon will be
coming to Haifa another 300 tons of granite, some of it with beautiful carved
ornamentation.</p>

<p n="7">The Guardian would like you to please convey to the Adelaide Spiritual
Assembly his deep appreciation of the contribution they made through your
Body to the Shrine Fund here in Haifa, a contribution which represents the
sum of their Property Fund.  They showed in this matter an exemplary spirit,
and placed the major issue in its true perspective, forgetting their local hopes
and aspirations in order that the work on the glorious Shrine of the <w type="dw">Bab</w>
might be carried forward more speedily.</p>

<p n="8">In regard to your question concerning the Centenary of the birth of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> mission: The Guardian, at a later date, will give instructions
concerning this commemoration to the entire <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World.</p>

<p n="9"><pb n="299"/>He has been particularly pleased to note, during the past year, the
increase in pioneer activity going on under your jurisdiction.  As you know,
he attaches the greatest importance to this type of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> service; and he
hopes that more of the believers will arise and go forth into the field,
establishing new centers and groups, and broadcasting the Message of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> over the face of that vast continent.</p>

<p n="10">This is at once their greatest duty and privilege, and one which will
attract the blessings of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and enrich, not only each individual
who arises to serve, but the entire Community of which he forms a part.</p>

<p n="11">Whenever the friends feel that they are small in number, and the effort
required, truly colossal, they should remember what the British <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
accomplished during the Six Year Plan; and how, after the long and
exhaustive years of the war and all its restrictions, they succeeded, at the
point of utter exhaustion, one might say, in achieving every single goal
gloriously.  The Australian and New Zealand friends, who have not been
subjected to such rigours during the last decade, who are a young and fresh
nation, so to speak, can surely accomplish as much, and one would imagine
more, than their British brethren, who laboured under such great handicaps.</p>

<p n="12">He assures you all that he will remember you in his prayers at the Holy
Threshold, and supplicate that your Assembly, and the Community of
believers whom you represent, may achieve great things during the coming
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> year and arise to new heights of self-sacrifice and service.</p>

<closer>
<salute>With warm <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> love,</salute>
<signed>R. Rabbani.</signed>
<lb/>
P.S.  I would like to add that the Guardian does not consider that it is advisable
for New Zealand to be separated in the near future from Australia, and
come under the jurisdiction of an independent National Assembly.  He
considers that the present arrangement is the best one until such time as
there are more Assemblies flourishing in New Zealand, and he would consider
the basis for a National Assembly strong enough there to support such an
institution.
<lb/>
Regarding the question of Mr Perdu, the Guardian was considerably
surprised at his temerity in getting in touch with the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.  He belongs to
an old family of Covenant-breakers from the days of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>, was later
pardoned by the Guardian, and a number of years ago, flagrantly disobeyed
the Guardian, and was put out of our local Community here.  We all know
that he has been in constant association with the Covenant-breakers ever
since, and he even admits it in his own letter!  Needless to say, the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
should consider him a Covenant-breaker, and shun him entirely.  The harm
that he could do a Community if treated otherwise, would be very great
indeed.
<lb/>
<pb n="300"/>[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The manifold and ever multiplying activities in which the Australian, New
Zealand and Tasmanian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities are so devotedly and unitedly engaged
are the object of my constant solicitude, and evoke, as they steadily expand, feelings
of gratitude and admiration in my heart.  Though unavoidably prevented from
communicating more frequently with their elected national representatives, who
are directing with exemplary loyalty, unrelaxing vigilance, inflexible resolve,
unsparing devotion and commendable foresight, the course of these highly
meritorious and promising activities, I follow, through the perusal of the various
reports and news letters I receive from them, every development in the unfoldment
of their work, and surround them as they labour so assiduously for their Cause,
with my fervent prayers, offered on their behalf in the Holy Shrines.
<lb/>
The assistance they have so spontaneously and enthusiastically extended to
the newly established centre in the Fiji Islands, constituting the opening phase of
the crusade destined to be systematically launched by them in the Pacific Islands--
a territory with which their spiritual destiny is irrevocably linked--has been
particularly gratifying and merits unstinted praise.  To have undertaken this
additional task, with such determination and fervour, while immersed in the labours
associated with the prosecution of their Plan, is surely an evidence of their youthful
vitality, their unbounded devotion to the interests of the Faith, and their eager
desire to emulate the example of the sister-communities which have initiated, over
and above their prescribed tasks, enterprises beyond the confines of their respective
homelands.
<lb/>
While this historic undertaking is being carried forward by their elected national
representatives, these communities must concentrate their attention on the pressing
and inescapable requirements of the Plan to which they stand committed.  The
process of extending the range of their administrative activities through the formation
of groups and the multiplication of Assemblies must continue unabated until this
particular objective of the Plan is fully achieved.  The proper incorporation of the
national and Local Assemblies, so vital and urgent at the present stage of their
evolution, must be hastened by every means in their power.  The measures required
to ensure the recognition of the Faith, of its laws regarding matters of personal
status, as well as its Holy Days, by the civil authorities, in both Australia and
New Zealand, must be carefully considered, and promptly adopted.  The institutions
of summer and winter schools, so vital and beneficial at the present stage in the
development of the Faith must be continually expanded enriched and consolidated.
The national and local Funds, on which the prosperity and unfoldment of a rising
Administrative system must ultimately depend, should be assured of an ever-increasing
measure of support, whilst the contributions of the believers for the
raising of the superstructure of the <w type="dw">Bab's</w> Holy Sepulchre, constituting a sacred
and added responsibility at this present critical hour, should be constantly borne in
mind and steadily maintained.  The deepening and enrichment of the spiritual life
<pb n="301"/>of the individual believer, his increasing comprehension of the essential verities
underlying this Faith, his training in its administrative processes, his understanding
of the fundamentals of the Covenants established by its Author and the authorised
Interpreter of its teachings should be made the supreme objectives of the national
representatives responsible for the edification, the progress and consolidation of
these communities.
<lb/>
This two fold task, both at home and abroad, confronting the members of
these communities, labouring so valiantly, and holding aloft so courageously the
banner of the Most Great Name in the Antipodes, at so crucial a stage in the
evolution of the human race on this planet, can neither be shirked nor be treated
lightly for one moment.  The hour is too critical, time is too short, the requirements
of an infant Faith are too pressing, the resources at the disposal of the few into
whose hands its care has been entrusted are too circumscribed to suffer any time to
be lost in procrastination or through complacency or neglect.  The prizes destined
for the heroic warriors, battling for the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> throughout the
Southern Hemisphere, and particularly Australasia, are glorious beyond compare.
The assistance to be vouchsafed to them from on high in their struggle for its
establishment to recognition and triumph is ready to be poured forth in astonishing
abundance.  Action immediate and wholehearted, coupled with unswerving fidelity
and dogged perseverance, will no doubt enable those who participate in this double
crusade, to attract the full measure of these blessings and to attain these glorious
goals.

<salute>Dear ....,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter of March 20th has been received; and our beloved Guardian
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He was very sorry to hear that you are contemplating separation from
your husband.  As you no doubt know, <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> considers the marriage
bond very sacred; and only under very exceptional and unbearable
circumstances is divorce advisable for <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian does not tell you that you must not divorce your husband;
but he does urge you to consider prayerfully, not only because you are a
believer and anxious to obey the laws of God, but also for the sake of the
happiness of your children, whether it is not possible for you to rise above
the limitations you have felt in your marriage hitherto, and make a go of it
together.</p>

<p n="4">We often feel that our happiness lies in a certain direction; and yet, if
we have to pay too heavy a price for it in the end we may discover that we
have not really purchased either freedom or happiness, but just some new
situation of frustration and disillusion.</p>

<p n="5">In any case, the Guardian assures you that he will pray for your
protection and guidance in the Holy Shrines, and for that of your dear
children and Mr ..., as well.</p>

<p n="6">He urges you to persevere in the service of the Faith which has already
blessed you so richly, and which, under your circumstances is your stronghold.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding various matters raised in your letters:</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian feels that as Mr. Audenwood clearly signified his belief
in <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> before his passing, his name should by all means be registered
in your records as a believer.  Please assure his wife of the Guardian's prayers

<p n="4">Shoghi Effendi feels it is better not to put the Greatest Name on <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
graves.  It is not forbidden to do so, but inappropriate.</p>

<p n="5">Regarding Mr ... and Mr ... we all regret exceedingly the loss he afflicted
this believer with.  Your Assembly, if you have not already done so, should
write both the Persian and Indian Assemblies exposing him, and asking if
there is no way he can be reached and made to pay his debt.  The last news
the Guardian had of him he was in Cyprus and planned to go on to <w type="dw">Iran</w> or
India.  It is most extraordinary to see the way this man, who breaks all the
laws of his Faith and disobeys both the Guardian and the Assemblies, has
been able to plant a firm faith in the hearts of sincere souls in Fiji, who are
now devoted believers!  Your Assembly should give this small community
every aid and encouragement you can, for its members were born with a
terrific test, enough to shake the belief of old and tried <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="6">The Guardian was very pleased to see the Racing Conference

You should keep up this contact and when you write please assure him of
the Guardian's appreciation of his steadfastness and of his loving prayers.
<pb n="310"/>He advises you to keep for your library the books sent you.</p>

<p n="8">The Guardian has noted a new spirit of love and unity amongst the
Australian and New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,which pleases him very much, as the
atmosphere of harmony amongst the friends will attract the Divine Blessings
and enable them to achieve a great deal more for the Faith.</p>

<p n="9">He strongly feels that the time has come for the believers of Australia
and New Zealand to arise as a conquering army and ensure the attainment
of their goals under their Six Year Plan.  They now constitute one of the
strongest bodies of believers in the world, ranking with such active and well
established communities as those of Canada, Great Britain and India.  Their
period of adolescence in the Faith has passed; they are now adults, and they
must face the problems involved in fulfilling their Plan squarely and with
maturity.  The pleasant period of youthful irresponsibility, when they could
look on the work of the American and Persian Communities as the feats of
the strong, which they were not called upon to emulate, being too young, is
now passed forever.  They must sacrifice, concentrate on their tasks, plan
their actions and carry on their pioneer work with determination, realizing
they will have no one to blame for any failures, except themselves!  The
Guardian feels they are entirely capable of fulfilling their Plan.  He is proud
of the progress they have made and confident they can succeed if they really
try.</p>

<p n="10">He assures you all of his loving prayers for your guidance and for the
success of your work, the progress of which he follows with the keenest
interest.</p>

<lb/>
[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The Six-Year Plan, formulated by the elected representatives of the valiant
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities in Australasia, is now entering its final and most critical
stage.  If successfully terminated it will mark the conclusion of a memorable chapter
in the evolution of the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in the Antipodes, and will at the same
time herald the opening of the initial phase in the establishment of the institutions
of that Faith, beyond the borders of that far-off continent, in the numerous diversified
and widely scattered Islands of the South Pacific Ocean.  It will in fact signalize
the third stage in the evolution of the Faith in that newly opened, highly promising,
far-flung continent--an evolution which commenced, during the concluding decade
of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> ministry and of the Heroic Age of the Faith, with the birth and
rise of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administrative Order, and which was subsequently accelerated
through the formulation during the opening years of the Formative Age of the
<pb n="311"/><w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Dispensation, of two successive Plans, designed to broaden and reinforce
the foundations of that nascent Order in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania.
The inauguration of the third and most glorious phase in this historic and momentous
development must now depend on the consummation of the tasks willingly
shouldered by this youthful, this virile and greatly beloved community, which,
despite its physical remoteness from the heart and world centre of the Faith, the
smallness of its size, its limited resources and the vastness of the field under the
jurisdiction of its elected representatives, has made such great strides since its
inception, has shown such exemplary devotion and loyalty, and has preserved and
reinforced so nobly the solidity of its foundations.
<lb/>
This Community, which owes its birth to the revelation of the Tablets of the
Divine Plan, must now brace itself, during the fleeting months that lie ahead, for
a supreme, a concerted and sustained effort to ensure the attainment of the objectives
of the present Plan, and thereby acquire the spiritual potentialities essential to the
launching of a mighty Crusade, in collaboration with the Trustees of the Plan,
conceived by the Center of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Covenant, and with its neighbouring
sister communities in Latin America and in the Indian Sub-continent, destined to
culminate in the fullness of time in the Spiritual conquest of the multitudinous
islands of the South Pacific Ocean.
<lb/>
So exalted a mission, so strenuous a task, so weighty a responsibility call for,
while the Present Preparatory Plan speeds to its end, an unprecedented
demonstration on the part of young and old, of both men and women, whether
administrators or teachers, veterans or neophytes, of solidarity, determination,
zeal and constancy, a still greater display of self-sacrifice, a wider dispersion of
forces, a more energetic discharge of duty, a clearer vision, a firmer grasp, of the
requirements of the present hour, and a more complete dedication to the purposes
of the present-day enterprise.
<lb/>
The steady multiplication of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Administrative institutions; the rapid
consolidation of these basic agencies on which the speedy expansion of the
community beyond its borders must ultimately depend; the early incorporation of
all steadily functioning Assemblies as a means of further reinforcing a newly erected
administrative structure; the systematic and vigorous dissemination of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
literature, and the gradual proclamation of the Faith through the Press and Radio;
the initiation of measures designed to forge friendly links between these newly-fledged
Assemblies and local civil authorities, and a parallel effort aimed at the
strengthening of the ties binding the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Supreme Administrative Body with
both the Federal and State authorities--above all the constant deepening of the
spiritual life of the individual believers, the enrichment of community life, the
promotion of greater unity, harmony and cooperation among the rank and file of
the followers of the Faith--these are the essential prerequisites to which special
attention should be directed in preparation for the great campaign destined to be
launched in that remote corner of the globe, by one of the most youthful and
<pb n="312"/>promising <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> national communities, on the morrow of the world-wide
celebrations of the centenary of the birth of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Prophetic Mission.
<lb/>
Afire with the vision that now opens before their eyes; conscious of the
substantial share of responsibility they must assume, in conjunction with the Indian,
the Pakistani, the North American, and the Latin American followers of the Faith
of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, in uplifting the banner of the Most Great Name amidst the dwellers
of these scattered, distant and in some cases isolated, Islands of the South, and in
drawing them into the orbit of His constantly evolving Administrative Order;
fortified by the magnificent progress they themselves have achieved in their own
homelands; and confident of the irresistible and mysterious power instilled by the
Hand of Providence in every agency associated with His Most Holy Name, let the
members of these rapidly maturing, fast evolving, soundly established, <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities throughout Australasia arise, as they have never heretofore done,
and during the concluding phase of their present fate-laden Plan, to seal their high
endeavours with total and complete victory, and thereby open a chapter of
undreamt-of glory that will add an imperishable lustre to the annals of an immortal
Faith.
<lb/>
Just as their first collective enterprise, through its resounding success,
contributed its particular share of tribute to the memory of the Herald of their
Faith, on the occasion of the centenary of the birth of His Revelation, may their
present collective enterprise, through its consummation, qualify and empower them
to play a distinctive role in the celebration of the Great Jubilee that will mark the
hundredth anniversary of the birth of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Prophetic Mission.
<lb/>
A great opportunity lies before them.  Much of the present mighty task still
remains to be achieved.  Immense virgin fields stretch before them, flanked, on the
one side, by a sister community in the South American continent, and on the
other by another sister community in the vast Indian sub-continent, both ready
and eager to extend their help in prosecuting a memorable, a gigantic and supremely
arduous task.  May they, when the hour strikes, be found ready and well equipped
to assume the onerous responsibilities that will fall to their share.

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The beloved Guardian has received your letters of December 20 &amp; 21,
1951, February 12 and 26, March 11 and May 2, 1952, with enclosures, and
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">As regards various matters raised in your letters, Mr Perdu is now in
Khartoum, Sudan at the following address: Mr Perdu, C/--The Technical
Institute, Khartoum.  The reason the Guardian knows this is that he has
received a contribution from him for the Shrine, which he has asked the
Bank to trace back to the sender, so that he can return it to him.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian suggests you contact Mr Perdu, and press him to discharge
his debt to the believer in Fiji whom he has so grievously wronged, pointing
out to him that surely, if he expects any forgiveness from God, the first pre-requisite
is to conduct himself honestly.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian was very happy to hear that as a result of Mrs. Bolton's
trip to New Caledonia, there is now a believer in that far-off island.  He was
<pb n="324"/>also very happy to hear of the close contact you maintain with the friends
in Suva, and considers that this is extremely important, as of course at the
New Delhi conference, plans will have to be made for the unfoldment of
the Faith throughout all the Pacific Islands, and the more strong centers we
have to begin with, the better.</p>

<p n="5">As regards World Religion Day, the Guardian does not attach any
importance to what date the meeting is held on.  World Religion Day has
nothing to do with our Faith as such, but is merely a useful means of getting
the public together and bringing the Cause to them.</p>

<p n="6">He sees no reason why Mother Dunn should not have a companion in
the <w type="dw">Hazira</w>, and hopes that she will settle down there comfortably and happily.</p>

<p n="7">The sympathy you have expressed on the occasion of the passing of
dear Mr. Maxwell was much appreciated by the Guardian.  Although Mr.
Maxwell is naturally missed very much here, the services God in His bounty
enabled him to accomplish for the Faith preclude any feelings of sadness,
when we think of the blessings showered upon him.</p>

<p n="8">He urges your Assembly to constantly stimulate the believers to achieve
their goals.  It would be a great pity if, after the success of their First Plan,
their Second historic Plan did not likewise culminate in victory, more
particularly in view of the fact that the New Delhi conference will involve
the formation of work to be undertaken by eight National Bodies during a
ten year period.</p>

<p n="9">Consequently all Assemblies, not only yours, but all National
Assemblies all over the world, should, so to speak, clear the decks for action,
and wind up their present business, so that they will be free to carry out the
much more important work that lies ahead of them.</p>

<p n="10">The Guardian feels sure that the Australian and New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
can make and will make sufficient effort to consummate their Plan with
success.  He is certainly sustaining them with his ardent prayers.</p>

<p n="11">He assures you all that your labours are most deeply appreciated.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
Though extremely preoccupied, during recent months, with the constantly
expanding activities and manifold problems arising at the World Centre of the
Faith, necessitating, to my extreme regret, a considerable delay in acknowledging
your Assembly's communications, I have been watching, with close interest and
ever deepening admiration, the progressive unfoldment of the task which the
community of the believers in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania are so
valiantly shouldering.  I have noted, with particular gratification, the simultaneous
advance made in the extension of the teaching activities of the steadfast and self-sacrificing
<pb n="325"/>members of this forward-looking highly promising community, as well
as in the consolidation of the institutions which they are so laboriously establishing
throughout that far-away continent and its neighbouring Islands.  I rejoice at the
remarkable vitality, courage and determination which they are increasingly
demonstrating in enlarging the limits of the Faith and in implanting its banner
beyond the confines of that continent, over and above the task assigned to them in
accordance with the provisions of their Plan, and in territories where they are
destined to exert a notable influence through their collective efforts and achievements
in the years immediately ahead.
<lb/>
As the Plan, to which they stand committed, enters upon the last stage in its
unfoldment the members of this community, however remarkable their
accomplishments have been in the past, must steel themselves and through a supreme
effort, endeavour to rise to still greater heights of dedication, display in the pioneering
field a still more compelling degree of consecration, evince a still nobler spirit of
self-abnegation, and a greater awareness of the gravity of the issues at stake and of
the inestimable value of the prizes within their reach.  That they may be qualified
to undertake a still greater mission, assume weightier responsibilities and embark
upon mightier enterprises, the adequate discharge of their present duties and the
fulfilment of their sacred obligations is no doubt essential.
<lb/>
The multiplication and consolidation of the Administrative Institutions of the
Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> throughout Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania, as its
followers in those regions, must undoubtedly be well aware, constitutes the primary
foundation for, and the necessary prelude to, the firm establishment of the
institutions of His Administrative Order, beyond the confines and in the
neighbourhood of these territories, and amidst the highly diversified tribes and races
inhabiting the numerous and widely scattered islands and archipelagos of the South
Pacific Ocean.
<lb/>
The approaching Holy Year, a period of such unique significance in the history
of the Faith; the prospect of the active participation of some of the elected
representatives and members of the community holding aloft the torch of the Faith
in the Antipodes; in one of the most important Conferences to be held during that
year; their formal association with no less than seven other National Spiritual
Assemblies in the prosecution of the colossal tasks that are to be initiated in South
East Asia, in the course of the coming decade; the manifold blessings which must
assuredly flow from the assumption of such a sacred function and in the course of
the development of so gigantic, so challenging and so meritorious an undertaking,
can surely not fail to galvanize the privileged members of this community,
constituting a vital outpost of the Faith, and occupying such a spiritually strategic
position in the world crusade soon to be launched by itself and its sister communities
in both the East and the West, into action, at once so swift and decisive, as to add
fresh lustre to the annals of the Faith.
<lb/>
<pb n="326"/>This community, now standing on the threshold of an era of unprecedented
expansion, and gazing towards the glorious future that awaits it, must seize the
priceless opportunities which these fast-fleeting months offer it, and must not allow
for a moment its vision to be dimmed, its resolution to flag, its attention to be
distracted or its faith in its ultimate destiny to waver.
<lb/>
With a heart full of hope, and with an affection and fervour which every
forward step in the progress of its strenuous labours serves to intensify, I will
supplicate at the threshold of the Shrine of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to enable His stalwart
followers championing His Cause in those far-away lands to achieve a resounding
success in the task they have pledged themselves to fulfil.

<p n="1">Your letter of November 13th has been received by the beloved
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He would be very happy to see you here after the Indian Conference,
<pb n="332"/>but suggests that the middle of November would be a better date than the
first.  If this does not work in with your plans, he suggests that you arrange
on your return to Australia, to pass through Haifa, rather than on your way
to the United States.  Either way would suit him, but please inform us of the
date you plan to be here, well in advance.</p>

<p n="3">He feels sure the conference in New Delhi will be of tremendous
interest, and it certainly will deal with one of the most vital aspects of the
coming Ten Year Plan.  He was most happy to hear you will both be attending.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter of November 12th has been received, and the beloved

<p n="2">He would be very happy indeed if you and your dear husband could be
present at the New Delhi Conference; and he will pray that the way may
open for you to attend it.</p>

<p n="3">The friends have every right to appeal to the Australian National
Assembly and express their views that Else Norden be allowed to teach
people of all races as she has been doing; but in the meantime she should
comply with the wishes of the National Assembly, because all <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> must
learn to live according to the administrative principles of our Faith.  If they
don't, they only undermine the very institutions they are trying to create,
and which we know, carry the solution to the world's problems.  It is often
difficult to follow this course, but it is the one <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> always asked
the friends to follow; and obedience, even when we believe the instruction
is not wise, brings in itself blessings from on high.</p>

<p n="4">Your devoted services to the Faith, and those of your dear husband, are
greatly appreciated, you may be sure; and he will remember you both in his
prayers in the Holy Shrines.</p>

<p n="1">The beloved Guardian has received your letter of April 4th, and has
instructed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">The contribution which has been made by the friends in Australia and
New Zealand for the construction work on the Shrine of the <w type="dw">Bab</w>, is very
deeply appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed herewith.</p>

<p n="3">Will you please extend to all the Assemblies, Groups and individual
believers who have joined in this contribution, the Guardian's heartfelt
appreciation.</p>

<p n="4">Shoghi Effendi was delighted to learn that the Six Year Teaching Plan
was successfully concluded.  Word coming into Haifa from all over the world
indicates the great success of the teaching plans in every country.  He is
therefore encouraged to feel that the heavy tasks of the Ten Year Plan will
be easily accomplished.</p>

<p n="5">You will be happy to know that the work on the dome of the Shrine is
progressing very rapidly.  As the Guardian has cabled, the shutterings and
the scaffolding for the dome have been completed, and some of the golden
tiles placed on lower sections of the dome.  The building achieves greater

<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Our Beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by reports reaching
him from all parts of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World of the victories already gained, and
the plans being laid for the prosecution of the Ten Year Crusade.</p>

<p n="2">They have evoked his awe-inspiring, and soul-stirring cablegram of
<pb n="339"/>May 28th, calling for the immediate settlement of all the 131 virgin areas of
the Plan.  He is convinced that the Friends will arise and translate their
enthusiasm into Action, because the Keynote of the Crusade must be Action,
Action, Action!</p>

<p n="3">The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your Assembly to
amplify some of the aspects of his dynamic message.</p>

<p n="4">The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an emergency nature,
that he feels pioneering in one of them, takes precedence over every other
type of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> service--whether it be in the teaching or administrative fields
of the Faith.</p>

<p n="5">In the United States some 150 people have volunteered for pioneer
service, and some of them already are preparing to leave for their posts.
The Guardian has informed the United States National Assembly, that
because of their being the Chief Executor of the Divine Plan of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>
for teaching throughout the World, their pioneers may be sent to any
virgin area in the world, regardless to which NSA it may be assigned.  If any
of their pioneers wish to settle in any of the areas assigned to your Assembly,
they will communicate with you.</p>

<p n="6">The Friends in Australia and New Zealand have displayed such
outstanding devotion and consecration to the Faith, that despite all obstacles
they have continuously "scattered" to various parts to spread the Divine
Teachings.  The Beloved Guardian is sure they will do likewise in connection
with this great Crusade and will settle promptly many virgin areas.</p>

<p n="7">There are some general observations which the Guardian shares with
you, and then some specific suggestions which are enumerated below:</p>

<p n="8">1. Every individual who offers to pioneer, should be encouraged and
assisted in every way possible by the National Assembly.</p>

<p n="9">2. Every application for pioneering must be expedited, and not allowed
to drag in any way, either in the handling of the NSA, or any Committee
working out the details for the NSA.</p>

<p n="10">3. The National Assembly must make the settlement of their virgin
areas, the first order of their business.  In other words, nothing is more
important at this time, than settlement in the 131 virgin areas.</p>

<p n="11">4. More than two pioneers should not be sent to any one place; unless,
of course, they are members of one family.  In fact, what is wanted is to settle
each area with <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,and therefore, one <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> will fulfil the initial task.</p>

<p n="12">The specific suggestions which the Guardian makes, are:</p>

<p n="13">a. Areas close at hand and easy of settlement should be filled first.
Then the areas more difficult, and finally, the difficult ones.</p>

<p n="14">b. Whenever a pioneer enters a new territory, a cable should be sent at
once to the Beloved Guardian, giving the name, place and any pertinent
information.</p>

<p n="15"><pb n="340"/>c. A report should be sent each month by your Assembly to the Secretary
General of the International <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Council, giving the progress of your
teaching work in the virgin areas of the Plan, particularly the development
of your plans for settling them.  This does not mean your Assembly should
correspond with the International Council concerning administrative
matters; as all administrative matters should be handled in the usual manner,
directly with the Guardian.  It simply means that reports and data concerning
the development of the plan should be sent to the International Council
for consolidation with other reports, for the Guardian.</p>

<p n="16">d. The Guardian feels the following areas should be easily settled and
he would appreciate your arranging to send pioneers there at the earliest
possible date.  Portuguese Timor, New Hebrides Islands, Admiralty Islands;
and then the other Islands as you can place pioneers on them.</p>

<p n="17">As his dramatic cable indicates, the Guardian is preparing an
illuminated "Roll of Honour", on which will be inscribed the names of the
"Knights of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>" who first enter these 131 virgin areas.  This "Roll
of Honour" will be placed inside the entrance door of the Inner Sanctuary
of the Tomb of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.</p>

<p n="18">From time to time, the Guardian will announce to the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World,
the names of those Holy Souls who arise under the conditions outlined in
his message, and settle these areas, and conquer them for God.</p>

<p n="19">Now is the time for the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of the World to demonstrate the spiritual
vitality of the Faith, and to arise as one soul to spread the Glory of the Lord
over the face of the Earth.  The Guardian is sure the spiritual power released
with the launching of this Great Ten Year Global Crusade, will carry the
consecrated and devoted friends to complete victory.</p>

<p n="20">He will pray for the members of your Assembly, whose sacrificial services
he greatly values.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letters of June 18, July 29, October 7, 21 and 24 (2), November
10 and 18, 1952, and February 19, May 18 and 21, 1953 have been received
by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his
behalf.  The various enclosures as well as material forwarded under separate
cover were also received.</p>

<p n="2">Owing to extreme pressure of work here, which is getting worse all the
time, he has not been able to answer any N.S.A. letters from any country
<pb n="341"/>for almost a year.  He regrets this but unfortunately it was unavoidable.  As
you can see, all your communications reached him, but he was too busy
to reply.</p>

<p n="3">He appreciated your Assembly's gift of books gotten out by the Child
Education Committee, and assures you that the four copies of the bulletin
"<bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl>, "<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Youth Journal" and other material which
you sent, are quite satisfactory.</p>

<p n="4">The thing that is most difficult for the Guardian is to have to read
through a sheaf of material in order to extract the salient information on
such vital subjects as pioneer activities, important decisions of the National
Assembly or the Teaching Committee etc.  Two words in the text of your
letter might convey important items in a succinct and summarized manner.</p>

<p n="5">He was delighted to hear that as many as thirty of the Australian
believers are planning to attend the New Delhi Conference, and that a
large number of N.S.A. members, if not all, will be present.  In a way, the
New Delhi Conference is one of the most important of all four conferences
to be held during the Holy Year, because at it, eight National Assemblies
must be represented and their joint teaching endeavour covers vast areas of
the globe, areas practically hitherto untouched by the Message of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.</p>

<p n="6">He was glad to hear that the Convention this year and the Pacific
School held afterward had been such a success.</p>

<p n="7">He was sorry to learn that after all, it was not possible for Mr. and Mrs.
Katzmann to go to New Britain.  He hopes that they or others will follow
through this project, as it is an extremely important one.</p>

<p n="8">The best photographs available of the Shrine of the <w type="dw">Bab</w> at present are
to be obtained from the American N.S.A., as films are placed at their disposal,
and they can fulfil your requirements.  He suggests you get in touch with
Mr. Holley.</p>

<p n="9">Shoghi Effendi hopes that at the New Delhi Conference the
contribution which the representatives from Australia and New Zealand
will make will be vital and will carry the work forward much faster.  It will
be a truly unique opportunity for the representatives of so many National
Assemblies to consult about the vast pioneers regions which will be entrusted
to their care, and every advantage should be taken of it, as it may not recur
again ever.</p>

The victorious conclusion of the Plan formulated by your Assembly, which
posterity will recognize as a landmark of the utmost significance in the development
of the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in the Antipodes, has filled my heart with joy and
thanksgiving, has evoked profound admiration in the hearts of the followers of the
Faith in both Hemispheres, and fully qualified the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Communities in Australia,
New Zealand and Tasmania to embark upon their Ten-Year Plan, which constitutes
so important and vital a phase of the global Crusade launched by their sister
Communities in every continent of the globe.
<lb/>
This new milestone in the history of the Faith in Australasia signalizes the
opening of a new chapter in the progressive unfoldment of the Mission of these
communities--a Mission that embraces both their homelands as well as the
neighbouring Islands of the South Pacific Ocean and where their most brilliant
exploits, testifying to their heroism and devotion, must be achieved and their greatest
victories won.
<lb/>
A twofold task of far-reaching importance, at once thrilling and arduous, now
faces them, involving the steady multiplication and consolidation of the nascent
institutions of the Faith in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania and the erection
of the Administrative structure of the Faith in the islands and archipelagos beyond
the shores of the Australian continent.
<lb/>
The despatch of pioneers to the seven virgin islands assigned to the National
Assembly of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of Australia and New Zealand is the first and most vital
objective of the newly launched Ten-Year Plan, requiring urgent consideration,
careful planning, and energetic action, in the course of the current year.  Every
effort should be exerted and the utmost sacrifice should be made, to ensure, ere the
opening year of this great and historic Plan draws to a close, the settlement of at
least one pioneer in each of these Islands--an achievement which will seal with
success the opening phase of the collective enterprise auspiciously launched by
your Assembly on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the birth of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Mission.
<lb/>
Second in importance and far-reaching in its repercussions is the selection and
purchase by your Assembly--an undertaking to which <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> National Assemblies,
as well as myself, will contribute--of the site of the first <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w> in the
Antipodes, to be situated either within or in the immediate outskirts of, the city of
Sydney, the leading and oldest <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> centre in the Australian continent, and
which already houses the National Administrative Headquarters of your Assembly.
<lb/>
These two essential obligations, as well as the task of consolidating steadily the
prizes already won in the administrative field in that continent, must take precedence
over all other obligations assumed by the prosecutors of the Plan, and will, if
fulfilled in time, constitute a splendid prelude to its systematic execution and eventual
consummation.
<lb/>
<pb n="343"/>The valiant and youthful <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities established in Australia, New
Zealand and Tasmania, which despite their limited resources, the smallness of
their numbers, their relative inexperience, and the various obstacles which have
confronted them in the past, have proved themselves capable of such memorable
feats, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activity, will, surely,
refuse to hesitate or falter at this crucial and challenging hour in the unfoldment of
their destiny, and will never allow themselves to be outdone by their sister-communities
who share with them the high and inescapable responsibility of
contributing to the final triumph of this, the most gigantic and momentous collective
undertaking launched since the inception of the Formative Age of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Dispensation.
<lb/>
I appeal to their elected national representatives to direct, with all the means
at their disposal, the operations of the Plan, and encourage constantly the members
of the Communities they represent to lend, each according to his or her resources
and capabilities, every possible assistance to this common task.  I entreat, moreover,
all Local Assemblies, groups and isolated believers to support, unstintingly, every
measure devised for the effective prosecution of this same task, and to continue in
this meritorious endeavour until every single objective of the Plan is attained.
<lb/>
May the followers of the Faith in that far-off continent, who can already boast
of such a proud record of stewardship to the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, illuminate its
annals, in the course of the coming decades by deeds of still greater renown, by
acts of still more glorious sacrifice, and prepare themselves to worthily contribute,
at the appointed time, to the world-wide celebrations which will commemorate the
Centenary of His Declaration.

<p n="2">In spite of your activities there in the teaching and administrative fields,
he considers pioneer work far more urgent at present.  No matter how much
the friends wish to go out as pioneers it is not possible for more than a few of
them to actually do so, and those who are willing to should arise with no
loss of time and go forth--and be inscribed on the roll of honour.  He therefore
urges you to make your plans to proceed to a virgin post, preferably in the
Pacific Islands, as soon as possible.</p>

<p n="3">He will pray that you may be richly blessed in this glorious undertaking.</p>

<p n="4">As regards the questions you asked: All these are within the competence
of the National Assembly to answer.  Indeed, he is encouraging the N.S.A.s
to attend to such secondary questions themselves.</p>

<p n="2">The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the <w type="dw">Bab</w> fund
<pb n="346"/>is greatly appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed herewith.</p>

<p n="3">The work on the Shrine is moving forward very rapidly at the present

<p n="4">The building is becoming more exquisite from day to day; and its

<p n="5">The Guardian is delighted with the initial response of the believers
throughout the world to the opening of the Ten Year Crusade.  He knows
this adds great responsibility to each and every believer.  He likewise is sure
that everyone will seize their opportunity to achieve immortal honor in

<p n="2">The Guardian very greatly appreciates your kind offer to serve him
here.  At the present time, however, he feels there are a sufficient number of
helpers in Haifa.</p>

<p n="3">However, there is probably a great need for your services as a youth, in
India and in adjoining virgin territories.  During this great World Crusade
recently launched, it will be the task of the National Spiritual Assembly of
India, Pakistan and Burma to open up to the Faith many virgin territories in
<pb n="347"/>widely-scattered areas of the globe.  The plans for the accomplishment of
this heavy task will be laid at the Intercontinental Teaching Conference, to
be held in New Delhi in October.  Therefore, the Guardian would urge you
to attend that Conference, as there you will probably get some idea of what
part you wish to play in this Ten-Year Crusade.</p>

<p n="4">If you wish to know what would most please the heart of the Guardian,
it is that these virgin territories be settled by at least one <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>, quickly.
This is the most important of all the goals for any <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community, for
the opening phase of the Crusade, and the more rapidly it can be
accomplished, the better it will be.</p>

<salute>[Panama] Mr. Roy Fernie.<note n="121" type="foot">Knights of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to the Gilbert &amp; Ellice Islands Colony.  This letter was
written to the Fernies prior to their departure from Panama.  Roy Fernie (1922 --
1964) was born in the Panama Canal Zone but spent his school years in England.
His Anglican family owned the C. Fernie Steamship Company.  At end of
WWII he returned to the Canal Zone from St. Louis Missouri, and soon after
heard of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith from his future wife, Elena Maria Marsella.  He became
a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in March 1953.  Elena Marsella, a concert pianist from Boston, joined
the US Foreign Service, and in 1945 pioneered with Ofelia Montalvo to Trujillo
in the Caribbean.  In 1950 she was elected Secretary of the first NSA of Central
America and Antilles.  With the announcement of the Crusade goals, the
Fernies resolved to pioneer in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (now the
independent states Kiribati and Tuvalu.)  They arrived in March 1954 and
settled at Abaiang, where sudden interest in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings antagonised
colonial authorities.  Mission opposition resulted in Roy Fernie's deportation
from the colony.  Pressure appears to have been put on Abaiang Catholics to
have the Fernies removed from the Island.  Although the charges against him
were clearly false (e.g.: his performance of theatrical tricks was reported as
influencing people with magic) Fernie was not allowed re-entry.  Roy Fernie
later worked in Hawaii; on Truk in the Eastern Caroline Islands; and in the
Marshall Islands, and died in Hawaii in October 1964.  Elena did not leave the
Gilberts with her husband as perhaps the authorities had expected, and
remained until another pioneer, Francis Heller, could replace her in 1956.  As
an Auxiliary Board Member from 1958 until 1964 she travelled widely in the
Pacific, notably to the Caroline, Mariana, Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahitian, and
Fijian Islands.  She authored several books, including <bibl><title>The Quest for Eden</title> <date>(1966)</date></bibl>.</note>

Portugal on 28 July 1954.  Unable at first to obtain a job, Marques appealed to
the Australian National Spiritual Assembly for assistance: the presence of a
continental Portuguese in Dili, having no employment, but receiving regular
payment from Australia, drew the suspicion of Timorese authorities on both
Marques and Fitzner, and both were threatened with immediate eviction.  When
Marques cabled the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World Centre for advice authorities intercepted
his message, searched his accommodation, seized his <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> books, and
interviewed Harold Fitzner for four hours.  Providentially, the Catholic Bishop
of Timor intervened, and both were permitted to stay.  In June 1957 Marques
married Miss Menezer, and in 1958 moved to Turascai, about 100 miles from
Dili.  In the 1960s the Marques family moved to South Australia.</note>

work of teaching, on people who live permanently in Guam, and any natives
who may reside there.  Thus, should you be transferred to another area, you
will leave a definite outpost behind, and the persons permanently residing
there, and the natives, can carry on the development and expansion of the
Faith after you leave.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian hopes you will be able to continue your assignment in
Guam, until you have been able to confirm some souls in the Divine Faith.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter of December 7th has been received, and the beloved

dear wife and gone way out to the Solomons; so this is not strictly speaking
a reply solely to such an old letter.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian is delighted that you have been able to proceed to the
Solomon Islands, and trusts that your life there will be comfortable and that
business opportunities will open up for you.</p>

<p n="3">He feels that this is a wonderful step that you have taken, and you may
be sure he is proud of you both, and that his loving prayers are offered for
your success in the Holy Shrine.</p>

<p n="4">He urges you to use tact and discretion in your teaching work, so as not
to alienate the officials or the missionaries, but to seek out and find those
souls who are receptive to the Message, rather than giving any publicity in
the beginning, to your activities.</p>

<p n="5">The most important thing for the pioneers to do is to consolidate their
position, and arrange if possible to remain permanently in these goal
territories.  Gradually they can find ways and means of spreading the Message,
and building Spiritual Assemblies and Groups.</p>

<p n="4">The most important thing, next to the pioneers going to their posts, is
for them to remain on the spot.  The difficulties of obtaining visas,
transportation, housing and employment are so great, that the friends who
have succeeded in reaching these destined goals, should do everything in
their power to remain; and, if they cannot get employment, the National

<p n="1">The Guardian requests that you inform all the friends that their most
important duty at the present time is the fulfilment of the tasks of the Ten-Year
Crusade.  This calls for the sacrifice of local activities in order that the
national and international development of the Faith may go forward
uninterruptedly.  No local institutions should be started.  The National
Assembly should see that money is not spent on local centres at this time,
and the friends should be encouraged to concentrate on the national and
international activities of the Faith.</p>

<p n="2">The beloved Guardian feels that steps should be taken immediately to
purchase the <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> in Auckland.  He is arranging for the
transmission of his initial gift of Five hundred pounds to this important
project...</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian calls attention to the fact that the <w type="dw">Hazira</w> cannot be a
rented place.  It must be the property owned by the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community.
Until such time as the National Assembly is formed and incorporated, it
can be held in the name of the Local Assembly, if it is incorporated, and if
not, in the name of an individual.</p>

<p n="4">The Guardian will appreciate advice from you as quickly as possible of
the steps being taken to fulfil this important task of the second phase of the

<salute>[National Spiritual Assembly]
<lb/>
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The letters from your Assembly dated July 6, September 14, November
9 and December 18, 1953, and January 7 (2), February 28, and March 22
and 31, 1954, with enclosures, also the material sent separately, have all
<pb n="364"/>been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer
you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">Regarding the various matters you have raised, he does not know how
the galleys of the Tahitian pamphlet and letters of Louise Bosch<note n="135" type="foot">John and Louise Bosch, of California, pioneered to Tahiti for five months in
1920.  Their property near Los Angeles became the Bosch School.</note> happened
to be sent to you.  He had nothing to do with it, and is perfectly satisfied
that they should remain in the hands of your Assembly.</p>

<p n="3">He has been delighted over the marked progress made by your Assembly
in carrying out its own portion of the Ten-Year Crusade.  The number of
members of the National Body who have gone forth as pioneers to virgin
territories which you have succeeded in opening during the first year of the
Plan, the purchase of the Temple site in Sydney--all attest the vitality of
the faith of the believers in the Antipodes.  He is very proud of their spirit
and their achievements, and believes that they will go very far in their service
to the Faith on an international scale.  The initiative shown through the
holding of a South Pacific School pleased him immensely.  In view of the
work to be done, the number of languages into which the literature is to be
translated, the tremendous area throughout which the Australian goals are
scattered, schools and institutes of this nature are really essential.</p>

<p n="4">He is also very happy to note the increase in <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> membership, a sure
sign of the virility of the faith of the believers.</p>

<p n="5">He feels sure that the visit of the dear Hand of the Cause, Mr. Furutan,
accompanied by Mr. Faizi, did a tremendous amount of good.  Mr. Furutan
has since made the pilgrimage to Haifa, and spoke very highly to the
Guardian of the believers in that part of the world, whom he grew to love
and admire very much during his visit.</p>

<p n="6">He was very happy to see that Mrs. Dunn was able to attend the New
Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Summer School.  For a woman of her age, this was surely a
remarkable achievement, and must have been a great inspiration to the
New Zealand friends, coming as she did so freshly from the last
Intercontinental Teaching Conference held in New Delhi.</p>

<p n="7">Now that so many of the goals abroad have been settled, and active
plans have been laid to settle the remaining ones, he feels that your Assembly
should pay particular attention, during the coming year, to the work on the
home front.  The multiplication of Local Assemblies, the incorporation of
Local Assemblies and the increase in centers throughout Australia and New
Zealand are all-important and pressing, and will require a great deal of work.
The sooner the friends "get on with it" the better!</p>

<p n="8">In connection with the teaching work throughout the Pacific area, he
fully believes that in many cases the white society is difficult to interest in
<pb n="365"/>anything but its own superficial activities.  The <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> must identify
themselves on the one hand, as much as they reasonably can, with the life
of the white people, so as not to become ostracized and eventually ousted
from their hard-won pioneer posts.  On the other hand, they must bear in
mind that the primary object of their living there is to teach the native
population the Faith.  This they must do with tact and discretion, in order
not to forfeit their foot-hold in these islands which are often so difficult of
access.</p>

<p n="9">Sound judgement, a great deal of patience and forbearance, faith and
nobility of conduct, must distinguish the pioneers, and be their helpers in
accomplishing the object of their journey to these far places.</p>

<p n="10">He attaches great importance to teaching the aboriginal Australians,
and also in converting more Maoris to the Faith, and hopes that the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
will devote some attention to contacting both of these minority groups.</p>

<p n="11">As he has already informed you, he approves of any surplus moneys in
the Temple fund, after having purchased the site, being diverted for the use
of the Pacific teaching work.  He feels that your Assembly has shown
remarkably good judgement in handling this entire matter.</p>

<p n="12">The most important thing of all in connection with the pioneer work,
is to ensure that the believers who, at such cost of sacrifice and effort, have
at last succeeded in gaining entry to these far-flung and difficult territories,
should remain there at all costs.</p>

<p n="13">As regards the question of how to write some of the Oriental words,
like <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> in the translations which have Latin script,
he feels that at least in parenthesis a phonetical pronunciation should be
included after the name when the English transliteration is used.  There is
no use giving people the Teachings, and not enabling them to pronounce
correctly the names that have the deepest association of all with our Faith.</p>

<p n="14">He urges your Body and, through you, all of the dear believers in
Australia and New Zealand, and your devoted pioneers serving so far afield,
to be of good heart, to persevere, and to rest assured that the Beloved will
watch over and protect your labours.</p>

<p n="15">He will pray for all the members of your Assembly in the Holy Shrines,
and for the success of your indefatigable labours.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The manifold evidences of the remarkable progress, achieved in almost every
field, by the Australian and New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Communities since the launching
of the Ten-Year Plan, have truly rejoiced my heart, and served to heighten my
feelings of admiration for the sterling qualities which the members of these
<pb n="366"/>Communities have increasingly displayed in recent years.
<lb/>
There is no doubt whatever--and I truly feel proud to place it on record--that
the community of the followers of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> labouring for His Cause in the
Antipodes now occupies, by virtue of the quality of the faith of its members, the
soundness of their judgement, the clearness of their vision, the scope of their
accomplishments, and their exemplary loyalty, courage and self-sacrifice, a foremost
position among its sister communities in all the continents of the globe.
<lb/>
Far from stagnating or declining in number or in influence it has in recent
years displayed a vitality which can well excite the admiration and envy of them
all, and has demonstrated, beyond the shadow of a doubt, a fidelity to the principles
of our Faith, whether a spiritual or administrative, and a capacity for service
which all may well emulate.
<lb/>
Though all the goals, in the virgin areas of the globe, assigned to the elected
national representatives of these two communities have not as yet been attained,
owing solely to circumstances beyond their control, yet the spirit evinced by the
pioneers belonging to these communities, who have so gloriously initiated this major
task, constituting the foremost objective of the opening phase of this Ten-Year
Crusade, has been such as to amply compensate for the inability of their national
elected representatives to consummate, ere the close of the first year of the Ten-Year
Plan, this initial enterprise marking the inauguration of their Mission in foreign
fields.  Particularly gratifying and indeed inspiring has been the response of the
members of your Assembly to the Call for pioneers--a response that has surpassed
that of any other National Body throughout the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World.
<lb/>
The selection and subsequent purchase of the site of the first <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w>
in the Antipodes in the outskirts of a city--the first to receive the light of the
Revelation of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in Australasia, and destined to play a predominant role
in the evolution of the Administrative Order of His Faith in that vast area--is an
achievement which I heartily welcome and for which I feel deeply grateful.  This
remarkable accomplishment will in conjunction with the establishment a decade
ago of the National <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> in that same city, accelerate the progress,
and immensely reinforce the foundations, of the administrative institutions
inaugurated on the morrow of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha's</w> ascension, and which are destined
to yield their fairest fruit in the Golden Age of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Dispensation.
<lb/>
The second phase of this spiritual Crusade upon which these two greatly blessed,
fast unfolding, firmly established, intensely alive communities have now entered
must witness the opening, at whatever cost, of the remaining virgin territories
allocated to their national elected representatives.  The preservation of the prizes
already won in the newly opened territories is, moreover, a task they cannot afford
to neglect under any circumstances.  The multiplication of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> isolated centres,
groups and Local Assemblies, in both Australia and New Zealand-a process that
has been steadily and rapidly developing since the inauguration of the Ten Year
<pb n="367"/>Plan, is likewise of paramount importance in the years immediately ahead.  The
development of these institutions, particularly in New Zealand, will no doubt
hasten the emergence of an independent National Spiritual Assembly in that
territory, and will lend a tremendous impetus to the onward march of the Faith in
those regions.
<lb/>
The assistance which your Assembly must increasingly extend to its sister
Assembly in the Indian sub-continent, in connection with the translation and
publication of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature in the languages allocated under the Ten-Year Plan,
is yet another task which, in the coming months, must be boldly tackled and
consistently carried on.  The incorporation of Local Assemblies moreover, is a
matter of great urgency and should in no wise be postponed or neglected.  The
consolidation work to be undertaken, according to the provisions of this same
Plan, is, likewise, urgent and of the utmost importance, and will undoubtedly
serve to enhance the prestige of your Assembly and enrich the record of your far-reaching
accomplishments.  The purchase of a building in Auckland destined to
serve as the National <w type="dw">Hazirat'ul-Quds</w> of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of New Zealand, is yet
another objective on which attention should be immediately focused--in anticipation
of the erection of yet another pillar of the future House of Justice in that remote
part of the world.
<lb/>
Whilst these objectives are being steadily pursued by your Assembly, every
effort will be exerted in the Holy Land, as a tribute to the superb spirit animating
the Australian and New Zealand believers and to their incessant and meritorious
labours in the service of the Cause they have championed, to hasten the transfer of
a part of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> international endowments to the name of the newly constituted
Israel Branch of your Assembly--an act that will at once bestow a great spiritual
and material benefit on your Assembly and reinforce the ties binding it to the
World Centre of the Faith in the Holy Land.
<lb/>
May the members of these valiant communities, whose interests you so
conscientiously serve and whom you so ably represent, continue to prosper under
your wise and loving leadership, scale loftier heights in their collective enterprise,
and win a still greater measure of fame in the service of a Cause to which they
have so nobly dedicated their resources, and which they have served, in the past
thirty years, with so rare a spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice.
<lb/>
That they may bring to full and early fruition the manifold tasks they have
undertaken is the constant prayer of one who has never ceased to love and admire
them for their past and present achievements, and for whose future accomplishments
he cherishes the brightest hopes.

<p n="1">ASSURE HOEHNKE<note n="136" type="foot">Knight of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to the Admiralty Islands.  The ninth child of Prudence
Alice Richards and Henry Hoehnke, Vi Hoehnke was raised in Brisbane before
moving to Sydney in 1939 to commence training as a nurse.  She was introduced
to the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Faith by Jim Heggie.  She regularly attended meetings held at the
home of Clara and Hyde Dunn, and was soon active on the National Youth
Committee.  In 1948 Vi moved to Melbourne to assist in re-establishing the
city's Local Assembly; later she pioneered to the provincial town of Ballarat.  At
the beginning of the Crusade Vi attended the New Delhi Conference and
decided to move to a French-speaking Pacific Island.  Unable to enter the
Loyalty Islands or the New Hebrides, she obtained a position as a nursing sister
in the Australian territory of Papua New Guinea.  She arrived in Port Moresby
on 12 April 1954, and arrived at Manus, Admiralty Islands, 6 July, 1955.  Despite
the colonial atmosphere and extreme racial prejudice and segregation of the
time, Vi made several Papua New Guinean friends, including Apelis Mazakmat,
a school teacher from Munawai, New Ireland.  In August that year Vi was
transferred from Manus to Rabaul by superiors unhappy at the extent of her
friendliness with the local people.  She subsequently returned to Port Moresby
and then to Madang Central Hospital, and in later years lived for periods in
Port Moresby, Madang, Samarai, Rabaul, Wewak, Goroka and Lae.  In 1964,
the year she was appointed Matron at Lae Base Hospital, Vi was appointed an
Auxiliary Board Member by Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone.  She retired
in 1971, and between 1973 and 1979 served as one of the Continental Board
of Counsellors for Australasia.  In 1974 she pioneered to Mt. Hagen, capital of
Western Highlands Province.  From here she travelled to surrounding villages,
passing on occasion warriors wielding bows and arrows, engaged in tribal
fighting.  On several occasions Vi was robbed and harassed, both in her home,
and in remote regions, but her indefatigable efforts have resulted in the
emergence of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> communities in the Western Highlands, Southern
Highlands, and Enga Provinces.</note> LOVING PRAYERS</p>

<p n="2">The news you conveyed rejoiced his heart.  He was particularly happy
to see that one of the Island people has become a follower, and has translated

be all the greater for your sacrifice; and that the example you have set will
sink deep into the hearts of, not only other pioneers, but the local people.</p>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>

<p n="1">Your letter of October 6th, with the interesting photograph you
enclosed, reached the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer
you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">The wonderful services you have been rendering in that distant outpost
of the Faith have greatly pleased the Guardian; and he was glad to hear that
Mr. Dobbins was able to join you, that his health is improving, and now his
mind is more at rest, and, as you say, he will be able to visualize you in the
place where you are pioneering.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian feels that your attitude is correct, and that you cannot
be too careful not to antagonize the authorities in any way.  By example, and
teaching where the occasion arises, and where it can give no offence, and
through perseverance, you will no doubt be able to achieve your object of
introducing the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> into these regions.</p>

<p n="4">He feels that we should not lay stress, to new <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>,on the necessity
of giving up smoking, especially as this is purely optional, and many of the
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w> still do smoke.  There are many things in the Teachings that require
a stiff effort on the part of a new believer, and we should not add to the
hurdles at the very beginning, so to speak.</p>

<p n="5">He is greatly encouraged over the way the work is going forward in all
continents of the globe and the islands throughout the seven seas.  It seems
unbelievable that in so short a time, so much should have been achieved;
and it shows that the days are rapidly approaching when the Cause will go
forward by leaps and bounds, and the masses will become attracted.</p>

<p n="6">You may be sure he remembers you, your dear husband and those whom
you are teaching, in his prayers in the Holy Shrines; and he urges you to
persevere and be of good cheer.</p>

Tabiteuea, studied at the Catholic seminary at Buota, Abaiang 1933 -- 38, but
decided against the priesthood and became a wireless operator, and later a

became a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>.  At the time of his declaration his Bishop had been trying to
persuade Kanare to re-join the Church and enter mission employment.  When
orders were given that Roy Fernie be deported, some two-hundred Abaiang
residents declared their position in the days prior to Fernie's departure by
announcing their wish to become <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.  Subsequent events were tragic.  On
Tarawa waiting for his wife to give birth, and for a ship to take them to Tabiteuea,
Kanare received a deportation order from the administration prohibiting him from
remaining on either Tarawa or Abainang.  Kanare's wife was denied adequate
medical treatment and died soon after childbirth.  Kanare returned to his home
island of Tabiteuea in the Southern Gilberts, and proceeded to spread the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>

Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friends:</salute>

<p n="1">The Beloved Guardian sends you his loving greetings.  He values your
devoted services to the Faith very much, and prays that you will be eminently
successful in all your activities, and win new goals and victories for the
Faith at all times.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian has received word recently, that the Cocos Islands had
become a part of the Australian Nation, or would soon do so;--also that the
inhabitants of the Islands would be given Australian citizenship.</p>

<p n="3">If that is the case, he hopes your Assembly will find it possible to send
a pioneer into the Islands, so another of the virgin goals of the Crusade will
be filled.  He feels if the Islands are now a part of Australia, it should not be
hard for an Australian citizen to enter the Islands, and teach the Faith there.
Will you please let me know in due course if anything can be done.  Do not
forget that anyone entering the Islands will become a Knight of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.</p>

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your loving letter of March 19th, has been received by the Beloved
Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.  The
contribution you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated,
Receipt is enclosed herewith.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian greatly values your devoted and sacrificial services to
the Cause of God, as well as those of your dear wife.  He will pray for your
guidance and confirmation; that every obstacle may be removed from your
path, and you be enabled to render distinguished and outstanding service to
our beloved Faith.</p>

<p n="3"><pb n="382"/>The Guardian enjoyed reading the copies of the <bibl><title level="j">Koala News</title></bibl> which
you attached to your letter.</p>

<p n="4">He attached the utmost importance to the Incorporation of the Local
Assemblies, and he hopes you will meet with every success in your
presentation to the Parliament in South Australia of a bill which will
automatically incorporate the existing five Assemblies in South Australia,
as well as other Assemblies as they come in to being.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian hopes likewise you will be successful in your efforts to
have the remaining virgin areas settled.  In this connection, he understands
that the Cocos Islands are to become a part of the Australian nation soon,
and those living on the Islands will be Australian citizens.  If that is the case,
couldn't some one from Australia pioneer, without difficulty, in the Cocos.
He would welcome this being done, if at all possible.</p>

<p n="6">The Guardian was also happy to learn of the active steps being taken
to translate the literature; and welcomes the report that the literature is
now being disseminated in Roviana.  In this connection, he asks that you
send the Blums, his deep appreciation of their services.  He values them
most highly, and prays for their complete success.</p>

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter of March 15th has been received by the beloved Guardian,
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He was very happy to hear of your activities in the service of the Faith;
and particularly that in Brisbane, the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>--a united Group, which attracts
the unfailing blessings of God,--are able to work with foreign students.  The
teaching of foreign students forms an excellent concomitant to the work in
the pioneer field.  Many times people from distant lands are converted abroad,
and return to either carry the Message to their own country for the first
time, or support the labours of some isolated and patient pioneer.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian thinks perhaps a different approach to the aborigines
might attract them; one of being interested in their lives and their folklore,
and of trying to become their friend, rather than trying to change them or
improve them.</p>

<p n="4">If you could form a friendship with an aborigine who had more spiritual
and mental capacity than the average, you might find out that out of this
friendship would spring an interest in the Faith; but no doubt great patience
<pb n="383"/>is required to enter into the thought of these people, so different from
ourselves in background and training.</p>

<p n="5">He feels you should concentrate on teaching people who will be able
to grasp the Faith; and, although work with spastic children is no doubt
highly meritorious as a philanthropic activity, in view of the fact that only
we <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> can give the Message to the people in these dark days, he thinks
it is a pity for a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> to waste too much time on that kind of work.  Direct
teaching is more important, especially teaching the aborigines.</p>

<p n="6">He will certainly pray for you and your dear mother, that you may be
successful in serving the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>.</p>

<p n="2">By dispersal the Guardian means the friends should get away entirely
from the large centers of population and, leaving a nucleus of about 15
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w> to maintain the Local Assembly, go settle, live and teach in new
towns, cities and even villages.  Naturally, it is no service to the Cause to
disperse if it breaks up an existing Assembly.  The purpose of dispersal is to
create more Assemblies over a wider area.  Until a given Assembly can spare
some of its local Community to go out and settle, they should by all means
at least do extension teaching.</p>

<p n="3">The status of Adelaide and adjacent Communities is a matter for the

was willing to go out and sell her home and move to a new area, he feels she

<p n="1">Your loving letter of June 27th, has come to hand and its contents
presented to the Beloved Guardian.</p>

<p n="2">He is very hopeful the plans for Mr. Wyss to return to Cocos will
materialise so that he may carry on actively the teaching of the Faith in
that important island.  The Guardian will pray for Mr. Wyss; that every
obstacle may be removed from his path, and he attain his goal of establishing
the Faith in Cocos.</p>

<p n="3">It is necessary for newly formed National Assemblies to have both their
Haziras and their Endowments.  So far as the Endowment is concerned, this
must be a piece of land, not funds; and need not be large.  In fact, something
costing about $1000.  Mrs. Amelia Collins, the beloved Hand of the Cause,
has contributed a fund to cover these endowments.  Therefore when you
purchase the endowment for New Zealand, you can apply to the American
NSA, as they are handling the distribution of these funds for her.  For the
purpose of this goal of the Crusade, Summer Schools, or Summer School
property is not considered an Endowment.  It must be a small plot purchased
exclusively for this purpose.</p>

<p n="4">So far as Suva is concerned, it will have to have its <w type="dw">Hazira</w> and
Endowment.  Again, the contribution of Mrs. Collins will make this a simple
matter.  As I understand it, the formation of the Regional Assembly for the
South Pacific is a responsibility of the American NSA, and therefore,
presumably, they will in due course take care of the Endowment goal directly.</p>

<p n="5">The Guardian is well pleased with the activities of the Friends in
Australia and New Zealand.  They are undertaking the fulfilment of their
responsibilities with determination, and he is sure they will not hesitate
until all the goals are won.</p>

<p n="6"><pb n="387"/>The Guardian was happy to learn of the progress of the Incorporations,
to which he attaches great importance.  Likewise he was pleased with the
translation of Mr. Christian's pamphlet into Pidgin English for use in Rabaul,
etc.<note n="148" type="foot">Dr. Kenneth Christian, (1912 -- 1959), Knight of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> to Southern
Rhodesia, died in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1959.</note></p>

<p n="7">The sufferings of the Persian <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> have been intense and severe.
The persecutions and atrocities are completely unwarranted.  Yet the Friends
are not flinching, and are an example of fortitude and devotion.  The spirit
which has been released through these sufferings must be seized by the Friends
in other parts of the world, and the torch of the Faith carried to new heights
and horizons, both physical and spiritual.</p>

<p n="8">The Guardian prays the Friends everywhere will arise with such a
determination as to offset the difficulties being experienced in Persia.</p>

<lb/>
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letters of July 27, August 5, and November 16, 1954, and January
21, and July 5, 1955, with enclosures, have been received by the beloved
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">He is very happy over the progress which has been made in the area
under your Assembly's jurisdiction during the past year.  The news of the
purchase of the <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> in Auckland was most welcome.  The
acquisition of this building is really one of the pre-requisites for the formation
of the National Assembly of New Zealand; he hopes that the impetus this
has given to the work of the Faith there, combined with the devotion of the
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w> will speed the formation of Local Assemblies, which alone constitute
the necessary firm foundation for the National Body, a Body which will be
one of the direct pillars supporting the International House of Justice.  He
urges, therefore, your Assembly to give all the teaching help it can to New
Zealand; and to encourage the believers there to do their utmost to achieve
their goals.</p>

<p n="3">The wonderful spirit the pioneers from Australia and New Zealand
have shown is a source of pride to the Guardian.  Already they have garnered
many rich prizes for the Faith in the form of such romantic, remote and
<pb n="388"/>inaccessible isles as Tonga, the Solomons and the Society Islands.  Their
determination, devotion and courage are exemplary in every way; and he
hopes they will persevere, and not abandon their posts.</p>

<p n="4">It must be made quite clear to the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> that opening a new territory
or a new town for that matter, meritorious as it is, is nevertheless only the
first move.  The consolidation of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> work undertaken there is the
most important thing of all.  Victories are won usually through a great deal
of patience, planning and perseverance, and rarely accomplished at a single
stroke.</p>

<p n="5">He was very glad to see that your Assembly had promptly gone to the
aid of Mr. Blum.  Without the support you gave him so generously and
quickly, he might well have been forced to abandon this important post,
which would have indeed been a great defeat to our work.</p>

<p n="6">He was very happy to receive the Samoan and Tongan pamphlets.
However restricted in size, such pamphlets as these are a great asset to the
literature of the Faith, and enable the teaching work to progress more rapidly.
He hopes that the pioneers will bear this in mind; and if they find any
languages that would be of real use to their teaching work, and can get a
small pamphlet translated into them, they will endeavour to do so.</p>

<p n="7">As he already cabled you, of the extra 3,000 Dollars which you had left
over in the <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> Fund for New Zealand, he wishes you to keep
half for the teaching activities carried out under your jurisdiction, and forward
the other half to England for the work there, as they are in need of assistance
in carrying forward the many important tasks allotted to the British National
Spiritual Assembly.</p>

<p n="8">The purchase of the Temple site--reasonable in sum, reasonable in
area, and excellent in position--brought great joy to his heart.</p>

<p n="9">He is indeed proud of the achievements of the believers of Australia
and New Zealand, and the well-balanced, intelligent and persevering manner
in which they go about their business.</p>

<p n="10">He hopes that the private bill you are planning to have passed in the
Upper Houses, and which will give the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> legal recognition, will go
through successfully.  In view of the precedent of the Canadian Parliament
when a special Act was passed, legalizing the status of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in that
country, he feels that you should not have much difficulty in Australia.</p>

<p n="11">He is hoping that, after the Ridvan elections, good news will reach
him of the formation of many more new Spiritual Assemblies in both
Australia and New Zealand.  The multiplication of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Centers is, at the
present stage of the development of the Cause, of the greatest importance.
In the first place, it means that news of the coming of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> is being
made available to a greater number of the population; and in the second
<pb n="389"/>place, it broadens the foundation of the national institutions which must
elect the International House of Justice.  Believers in centres that possess a
relatively large voting list should bear in mind that at this time it is highly
important and acceptable in the sight of God to disperse and carry the
Message to new Centres, both outside the country and within it.</p>

<p n="12">Your Assembly should bear in mind the necessity, in the future at any
rate, of having firmly grounded Local Assemblies in all of the States of
Australia and New Zealand; and also the importance of increasing the
representation of the minority races, such as the Aborigines and the Maoris,
within the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community.  Special effort should be made to contact
these people and to teach them; and the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in Australia and New
Zealand should consider that every one of them that can be won to the
Faith is a precious acquisition.</p>

<p n="13">As he surveys the progress being made throughout the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world,
he is particularly pleased with that achieved in the Antipodes.  The
soundness, healthiness and vigour of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community "down under"
is a source of great joy to him, and he feels is an example to the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in
other continents of the globe.</p>

<p n="14">He remembers the members of your Assembly and all the dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
pioneers and those labouring at home in his prayers in the Holy Shrines,
and supplicates that you all may be richly blessed, and render the Faith
devoted services.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The achievements that have distinguished and ennobled the record of services
rendered by the valiant, fast expanding, steadily consolidating, richly endowed,
highly promising <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Communities in the Antipodes have brought intense joy
to my heart, and have, no doubt, excited the admiration of the members of their
sister communities throughout the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> world.  The contribution which, severally
and collectively, the organised followers of the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in the Australian
continent, in New Zealand and in Tasmania, are making towards the progress of
the Ten-Year Crusade in so many of its aspects, ever since its inception, is truly
exemplary and augurs well for their future development and triumph under the
provisions of this momentous Ten Year Plan.
<lb/>
The steady increase in the number of believers, of isolated centres, groups and
Assemblies evokes my deep and heartfelt admiration and gratitude.  The purchase
of the site of the first <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w> in the Antipodes is a service that has
greatly enhanced the prestige of the Faith, and constitutes a historic victory worthy
to rank as a distinct milestone in the history of its progressive unfoldment throughout
Australasia.  The purchase of the <w type="dw">Haziratu'l-Quds</w> in Auckland, as the future
<pb n="390"/>headquarters of the New Zealand National Spiritual Assembly, is another
accomplishment that merits the highest praise.  The opening of the virgin territories
assigned, under the Ten-Year Plan, to the elected representatives of these
communities has, furthermore, demonstrated the readiness of the members of these
communities to speedily and worthily achieve the goals of this dynamic Plan in this
particular and vital sphere of collective <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> endeavour.  The assistance extended
by these same representatives to their brethren in the Indian sub-continent in
connection with the translation of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature into the languages allotted to
them, under this same Plan, affords, moreover, further evidence of their alacrity,
their devotion, their watchfulness in promoting, in every way possible, the manifold
interests of their beloved Faith at this crucial stage in its development and
consolidation.
<lb/>
Laden with such victories, conscious of the future brightness of their mission,
fully relying in the efficacy of that celestial aid which has at no time failed them in
the past, it behoves them to rededicate themselves, during the opening months of
the last year of the second phase of this world encompassing Crusade, to the tasks
they have so splendidly initiated.  The scope of their activities, now ranging out far
into the South Pacific Ocean, must rapidly widen.  Their determination to fulfil
their tasks must never for a moment falter.  Their vision of the glorious destiny
bound up with the triumphant accomplishment of their collective enterprise must
remain undimmed.  Their willingness to sacrifice unstintingly until every single
objective of the Plan has been achieved must, under no circumstances, be allowed
to weaken.  Their unity and solidarity in the pursuit and attainment of their
immediate as well as distant objectives must, at all times, continue unimpaired.
The prizes they have won, at the expense of so much sacrifice, in the islands
neighbouring the Australian continent, as well as in those lying further from its
shores in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans, must not, however strenuous the
effort required, be jeopardized.  The opening of the one remaining island as yet
unopened among those allotted to them under the Ten-Year Plan must be speedily
undertaken.  The translation of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature into the few remaining languages
which still require the concentrated attention of their elected representatives must
in no wise be neglected.  The process of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> incorporation, constituting one of
the most vital features of their collective enterprise, must be accelerated--however
formidable the obstacles which stand in their path.  The establishment of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
endowments in the Dominion of New Zealand is yet another responsibility devolving
upon their elected national representatives, a responsibility devolving upon their
elected national representatives, a responsibility which should be discharged prior
to the emergence of an independent National Assembly in that distant and promising
island.
<lb/>
Whilst these immediate goals are being steadily and resolutely pursued, attention
should, likewise, be particularly directed to the vital need for the constant
<pb n="391"/>multiplication of isolated centres, groups and Local Assemblies, as well as to the
necessity of increasing, to an unprecedented degree, the number of the avowed
adherents of the Faith who can directly and effectively contribute to the broadening
of its foundations and the expansion of its nascent institutions.  Particularly in the
Dominion of New Zealand, where a pillar of the future Universal House of Justice
will soon be erected, must a fresh impetus be lent to this vital process which can
alone reinforce the foundations on which this projected institution must ultimately
rest.
<lb/>
The Community of the followers of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in the Antipodes is approaching
a milestone of great significance in the course of its development through the
emergence of this major institution, destined to play a notable part in the evolution
of the administrative Order of the Faith in the Pacific Area.
<lb/>
Fully aware of their high and inescapable responsibilities at this crucial stage in
the expansion and consolidation of their institutions, challenged and stimulated by
the tragic and heart-rending tidings reaching them from <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> native land,
where a wave of persecution of uncommon severity has swept over His followers
in both the Capital and the provinces; conscious and appreciative of the blessing of
freedom so cruelly denied their oppressed brethren in the cradle of their Faith; and
determined to offset by their exertions the losses sustained by the Faith in that
land, the members of this privileged, this valiant and forward marching community
must display, in the months immediately ahead, such a spirit of devotion and of
self-sacrifice as will outshine the brilliance and glory of their past and present
achievements.
<lb/>
Theirs is an opportunity which they can not ignore or neglect.  Theirs is a duty
which if worthily performed will no doubt draw them closer to the throne of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and considerably enrich their share of inestimable blessings stored for
them in the <w type="dw">Abha</w> Kingdom.  May they by their response to the call of the present
hour prove themselves worthy of the high mission with which they have been
entrusted.

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your loving letter of September 5th has just come to hand, dealing
with the question of incorporations of Local Assemblies, and other matters.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian, as I have written you previously, is very anxious to have
Local Assemblies become incorporated, and as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p n="3">As I wrote you in my letter of August 20th, the Guardian has enunciated
the principle of the Constitution and <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> a number of times, and which
<pb n="393"/>were reiterated in my letter of August 20th.</p>

<p n="4">He now leaves it to your Assembly to handle these matters to a
conclusion with the Local Assemblies.</p>

<p n="5">Perhaps I have not made it clear, but the Guardian feels that there
should be no changes in the <bibl><title>By-Laws</title></bibl> and Constitution which has been put
into effect all over the world except such minor corrections as may be
necessary to adjust to local laws.  The reason I mention this is that in your
letter to the Local Assembly in Unley, you mention that should they have
any further doubts, or be unable to carry out all the incorporations in
accordance with the Guardian's instructions, they should let you know, and
you would again refer the matter to the Guardian.</p>

<p n="6">In the advices contained in my letter of August 20th, the Guardian
now leaves these matters to your Assembly to see that the general program
is followed.</p>

<p n="7">I note in your letter of September 5th, you deal with various matters
concerning which you had correspondence with the beloved Guardian, such
as the sale of the Temple site, settlers in northern Australia, etc.  If I may
suggest, I think it would be well, in writing to me, to write only about such
matters concerning which I have been instructed by the Guardian to address
you.  Other matters should be addressed directly to him.  In other words,
the policy he has adopted is that all correspondence should be addressed to
him concerning all administrative and spiritual matters with the exception
of certain items which he instructs me or someone else to correspond about.
There is no intermediate step at present between the Guardian and the
National Assemblies.</p>

<p n="1">At the instruction of the beloved Guardian, I am writing you this letter,
the contents of which he wishes your Assembly to regard as strictly
confidential for the time being, until such a time as he wishes to make it
public.</p>

<p n="2">He is seriously considering the possibility of having a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Temple
built in the Antipodes during the present 10 Year Plan, on the Temple site
already purchased in Sydney.  This would ensure a House of Worship in
every Continent of the globe by 1963.  Also, in view of the strong
recrudescence of persecution and hatred of the Faith in Persia he feels that
to erect Temples in Africa and Australasia--where it is possible to do so--
would be a great comfort to the Persian believers and a befitting response to
their enemies who may well make it unfeasible to build the Tehran Temple
during this Plan.</p>

<p n="3">In view of this he wishes you to approach qualified architects and request
Sketches--preliminary studies--for this Temple, which you can submit to
him as soon as possible and from which he can indicate the one he feels
would be most suitable.  He makes this suggestion of studies first because the
recent drawings submitted in competition in Germany (and forwarded to
him) were all highly modernistic and undignified and a lot of money and
time was spent for nothing.  There was only one he considered at all possible,
and this was not chosen by the judges; necessary <emph rend="italics">qualifications</emph>: a building
nine sides, surmounted by a dome.  Note--circular building.  Seating capacity
500 with possible additional seating in a balcony at a future date.  Height
40 to 45 meters.  Note: no assembly hall is to be included, only auditorium
for worship, with no surrounding rooms, is necessary.  Extra rooms for
maintenance, toilets, caretaker, can be in basement.</p>

<p n="4"><pb n="397"/>There is no reason why is should look like the Chicago Temple; on the
other hand, he feels these ultra-modern, often bizarre structures are not at
all in keeping with the dignity of our Faith.  The type of dome on such
structures as Mason Remey's Temple for Haifa, the Shrine of the <w type="dw">Bab</w> and
St. Peter's in Rome he considers beautiful in proportion and suitable.  The
style is naturally a question each architect would evolve for himself.  What
interests the Guardian is the symmetry of the ensemble and dignity.</p>

<p n="5">He would urge your Assembly to get preliminary studies to him at the
earliest possible date, and then he can indicate the one he feels most suitable
and the architect can work up full details later.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter of February 7th with photograph enclosed has been received
by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his
behalf.</p>

<p n="2">Although he was very happy to hear the news of the number of believers
that you and your dear wife have made in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, he
was very sorry to hear of your expulsion.</p>

<p n="3">As he has already informed the British National Assembly, we must do
all in our power to stay on good terms with the Authorities, even though
they are incited against us by missionaries or other enemies of the Faith,
and may treat us with injustice.</p>

<p n="4">He will certainly pray that the way may open for you to return; and, in
the meantime, he feels that your wife is doing the right thing by staying at
her post, however great the personal sacrifice involved for you both.</p>

<p n="5">Your devoted services have been deeply appreciated by him, and greatly
admired by <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in other pioneer posts, who have to sow, alas, in less
fertile soil!</p>

<salute>Mr. James Heggie, Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>
of Australia and New Zealand
<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Friend:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your loving letter of February 22nd was presented to the beloved
Guardian, and he has asked me to respond to you on his behalf, to the
questions which you raise as follows:</p>

<p n="2">He was very happy to receive the report concerning the translation of
languages.  As you know, he feels this is one of the tasks of the Ten Year
Crusade which can be brought to a conclusion at an early date; and he
therefore hopes your Assembly will follow up the subject just as diligently as
possible.  Furthermore the teaching work in the areas involved will be
hampered if the literature is not translated.</p>

<p n="3">He is very anxious that you proceed with the printing of the pamphlet
in Tahitian.  Please send me 5 copies for him just as quickly as it is off the
press.</p>

<p n="4">In connection with the incorporation of Assemblies, the Guardian feels
<pb n="403"/>that the general principle which was established by <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and
confirmed by the Master and is now in effect all over the world of confining
the territory of one Spiritual Assembly to one civil area, must now be followed
in Australia and New Zealand.  This is the principle that is now being
followed in practically all parts of the world, and should be followed now in
your very promising country.</p>

<p n="5">It is likely of course that this will result in a great many new communities
in Australia and New Zealand, which will spur the friends on to establish
Assemblies in each of these new areas, and thus ultimately increase the
number of Assemblies in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p n="6">In New York there are numerous boroughs which make up the civil
limits of New York; likewise in London there are various divisions with
local administrative bodies, all of which make up the City of London.
Presumably there is a similar situation in the cities in Australia where you
have local Councils, but all of them under the general supervision and
direction of one central body, which would be the general government of
the City.</p>

<p n="7">If this is the case, there are no objections to the N.S.A. adopting the
plan of recognising the area of the central government, and not breaking up
a city into various council areas.</p>

<p n="8">In other areas where <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> from surrounding communities help make
up the Spiritual Assembly and community of the given city, this of course
will have to be changed in accordance with the policy outlined herein.</p>

<p n="9">I trust this fully explains the matter to you.  If not, I shall be glad to
make further clarification.</p>

<p n="10">I regret my original letter of January 29th enclosing the title deeds to
the property on Mt. Carmel in the name of your Assembly was not signed.
I have now signed it, and enclose it herewith.</p>

<p n="11">The Guardian asked me to assure you all of his prayers in your behalf.
He is greatly pleased with the manner in which the Assembly is undertaking
its heavy responsibilities, and feels sure you will gain many important victories
for the Faith.</p>

<salute>Mr. H. Collis Featherstone, 24 Hargrave Street, Semaphore, South
Australia
<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your loving letter of April 4th was duly received, and its contents
presented to the beloved Guardian.</p>

<p n="2">He was greatly delighted to receive the information that you sent with
regard to the translations into new languages, and the victories in the
teaching field.  The spirit of confirmation seems to be descending over the
entire South and South-East Pacific areas, and the victories being won
everywhere indicate how badly the divine teachings are needed in those
areas.</p>

<p n="3">The beloved Guardian states he does not recognize the purported extract
from a Tablet of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> concerning Enoch.  He could not therefore rule
on its authenticity without seeing the original Tablet.  Even if it should come
<pb n="406"/>from a Writing of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, the translation is extremely poor.</p>

<p n="4">He feels under the circumstances that this should not be considered as
authentic <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature.</p>

<p n="5">If I might inject a personal thought, it is that I believe this purported
extract from a Tablet of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> can only refer to the initial paragraph
which is quoted and which does read like <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature.  However the
balance of the document appears to me to be quotations from the "Book of
Enoch" or a book covering the teachings of Enoch.  A number of years ago,
there was some interest developed concerning manuscripts which were found,
which were purported to be writings of an early Prophet who they thought
was Enoch.  I had both books referred to, and this reads like it is quoted
directly from one of the books.  I recall the interest amongst the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in
this matter in the days of my youth, and it was prior to the time of the
departure of Father Dunn for Australia and New Zealand.  He no doubt
took it with him.</p>

<p n="6">There must be some misunderstanding on the part of <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in Burnside
with regard to the readings at a Nineteen Day Feast.  The Writings of the
<w type="dw">Bab</w> and <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> can certainly be read any time at any place; likewise
the Writings of <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w> are read freely during the spiritual part of the
Feast.  The Guardian has instructed that during the spiritual part of the
feast, his own Writings should not be read.  In other words, during the spiritual
part of the Feast, readings should be confined to the Writings of the <w type="dw">Bab</w>,
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and to a lesser extent, of the Master; but during that part of the
Feast the Guardian's Writings should not be read.  During the period of
administrative discussion of the Feast, then the Guardian's Writings may be
read.  Of course during the administrative part of the Feast there can be no
objection to the reading of the Writings of the <w type="dw">Bab</w>, <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> or <w type="dw">Abdu'l-Baha</w>.</p>

thrilling letter from Mr. Hancock, telling of his joyous experiences on
the trip from Rabaul to New Ireland.</p>

<p n="2">Knowing the Guardian would be interested in reading Mr. Hancock's
letter, I submitted it to him.  He was very happy to learn of the reception of
the universal teachings of the Faith in that promising land, and he hopes
<pb n="407"/>the Faith will grow in depth in the hearts of the people.  His advice is that
rather than spread rapidly, and form new patterns of life too quickly, that
the teachers concentrate on a few strong capable souls, and see that they
are fully confirmed and deepened in the Faith, before spreading to larger
numbers.  Otherwise, when opposition comes, the local people will not be
sufficiently deepened in the Faith, to enable them to stand the pressure.</p>

<p n="3">The Guardian assures the Friends, particularly Mr. Hancock of his
prayers in their behalf; that they may be both guided and confirmed in their
work, and many souls become standard bearers of the new Day, in that area.</p>

<p n="3">He will also pray that your efforts to create a friendly relationship with
the Administrator will be successful.  Generally speaking, it is not wise to
involve the higher officials too much in our work; but it is good to let them
know, when this seems indicated, what we are doing, and create good will
on their part.</p>

<p n="4">For the time being, he thinks that, as long as the Government moved
you away from Manus, you should not try to get back there, but continue
where you are, building up the local work and quietly teaching as many
natives as you can.  If we attract the attention of the officials and the
missionaries to us too much, we will jeopardize our work in many of these
backward places in the world where there is a definite racial problem, either
nascent or well-developed.</p>

<p n="5">It would naturally be better if you could get back to one of the places

<p n="3">He was also pleased to see that you have found a friendly architect,
who will cooperate in submitting plans for the future Temple in Sydney.<note n="153" type="foot">Mr. John Brogan.</note>
He is eagerly looking forward to receiving them.  Since writing this, they
have been received.  He was also glad to hear that another site had been
procured.</p>

<p n="4">Repercussions of the Chicago Temple are felt everywhere, and the same
is becoming increasingly true of the Shrine.  One single edifice, raised to
the glory of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, shines like a beacon and attracts the hearts of the
people; no doubt many seeds are sown just through the act of people visiting
these edifices--seeds which in the future will germinate.  It is because of this
that he is very eager to have the Australian one commenced as soon as
circumstances permit.</p>

<p n="5">As regards the question the Auckland Assembly has asked about
vivisection, there is nothing on this subject in the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> teachings.  At a
future date such matters will no doubt be taken up by the International
House of Justice.</p>

<p n="6">He is very anxious to have as many Local Assemblies incorporated as
possible; and was hence very pleased to hear that your Assembly is
energetically prosecuting this part of the Ten Year Plan in both Australia
and New Zealand.</p>

<p n="7">The visits of the Australian friends to different centers in Australia
and New Zealand, as well as Mr. Featherstone's trip to some of the Pacific
Islands, have been much appreciated, and he feels sure that marked results
will be forthcoming.  Although you who labour in that distant continent
may often feel that your work is progressing but slowly, the Guardian, from
the prospective that he has here at the World Center, is well pleased with
the perseverance, the devotion and the achievements of the Australian and
New Zealand friends; and he is proud of their spirit, and feels sure that they
will accomplish their goals.</p>

<p n="8">He was very happy to hear that Mr. Marques has obtained permission to
remain in Timor.  His background makes him a very important pioneer
for that area; and he is happy that your Assembly was able to make it possible
for him to remain.</p>

<p n="9">The matter of the areas under the jurisdiction of a Local Spiritual
Assembly is one which the National Assembly must study, and apply the
principles laid down by the Guardian; namely, that within a municipal area,
where the people resident in the area pay taxes and vote, the Assembly can
be elected, and holds jurisdiction.  Anyone living outside of that area is not
<pb n="412"/>a member of that Community, and cannot enjoy the administrative privileges
of that Community.  Although this will effect your Assembly roll, it will
place the work of the Faith on a much sounder basis, and increase the number
of Centers where <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> reside throughout Australia, which is an important
phase of the work in any case.  It will challenge the friends to work harder to
create new Assemblies and make up for those dissolved; and he feels sure
that in the near future the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> will be very proud of the results they have
achieved through this change.</p>

<p n="10">He is delighted to hear that the New Zealand friends are so eagerly
carrying on their work in preparation for their National Assembly next year.
Their coming of age, so to speak, will be a source of pride to all their fellow
National Assemblies, and they will form a welcome addition to the pillars
which must ultimately sustain the International House of Justice.</p>

<p n="11">Regarding the question of capital punishment, provision is made for it
in the <bibl><title>Aqdas</title></bibl>, but this is not the time to go into details.  When the <bibl><title>Aqdas</title></bibl> is
promulgated and the House of Justice comes into being will be the time to
go into these matters in greater detail.  For the present they should be given
no publicity.</p>

<p n="12">Assuring you all of his loving prayers for the success of the work you
are doing.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
My heart overflows with gratitude, and my admiration is heightened, as I
contemplate the range and quality of the achievements of the devoted and valiant
adherents of the Faith in the Antipodes, who have in recent years so greatly
embellished the record of their services and contributed so remarkably to the progress
of the institutions of a divinely appointed Administrative order in that far-away
continent.
<lb/>
The entire <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> World beholds with pride and admiration the great victories
won by the Australian and New Zealand communities, both in their homelands
and in so many islands of the Pacific Ocean, and shares my confidence that their
historic accomplishments, particularly since the inception of the Ten-Year Plan,
are but a prelude to still nobler exploits and still mightier victories.
<lb/>
Their exemplary loyalty to the Faith they have so eagerly embraced, their keen
enthusiasm, their persistent endeavours, their willingness to sacrifice, their inflexible
resolve to surmount every obstacle, their unity and solidarity, their optimism and
courage, are assets which I greatly value, and for which I cannot but feel deeply
grateful.
<lb/>
Much indeed has been achieved by these stalwart defenders and promoters of
the Faith of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>!  To an extent which they themselves cannot estimate their
<pb n="413"/>individual and collective achievements, in both the teaching and administrative
spheres of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activity, have compensated for the enforced inactivity and the
disabilities suffered by their sorely tried brethren in Persia.  The first and second
phases of the Ten-Year Plan owe, to a very notable degree, their success to the
impetus which the splendid initiative and remarkable resourcefulness displayed by
the members of these communities has lent to the onward march of the Faith in
that continent.  In more than one way these communities, through their consecrated
efforts and the tangible results they have achieved, have set an inspiring example
to their sister communities in both the East and the West.  The Author of the
Divine Plan, Himself, who during the closing years of His ministry, witnessed the
awakening of that vast continent, rejoices over and applauds the rapidity with
which the light of His Father's Faith has spread over and enveloped that continent
and its neighbouring islands.
<lb/>
Much, however still remains to be achieved before the laurels of total and
complete victory are claimed.
<lb/>
The precarious situation in some of the newly opened territories allotted to
your Assembly must be given first consideration and should be speedily remedied.
Any, and every nucleus formed in those islands must be vigilantly safeguarded,
and, if possible, constantly enlarged and consolidated.
<lb/>
Special attention, during the opening year of the third phase of the Plan, must
be prayerfully accorded to the extension and consolidation of the homefront, with
particular emphasis on the rapid increase in the number of the adherents of the
Faith, and the multiplication of isolated centres, groups and Assemblies.  The process
of incorporation, so long held in abeyance, must be accelerated by every means
possible.
<lb/>
A supreme effort must be made, in the course of the current year, in conjunction
with the Indian National Spiritual Assembly, to bring to an early and successful
conclusion the translation of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> literature into the languages listed in the Plan,
thereby assuring the attainment of one of its vital objectives.
<lb/>
Particular attention should be devoted to the urgent needs of the New Zealand
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community, through the formulation of a plan which will enable it to swell
the number of its administrative institutions, enlarging and reinforcing thereby the
foundations on which its forthcoming National Assembly must ultimately rest.
<lb/>
The goals which both communities are called upon, at this crucial hour in the
evolution of the Plan, to achieve have been clearly defined and repeatedly
emphasised.  The task, however, is vast and arduous.  The effort that must needs
be exerted by the rank and file of the believers is immense.  The challenge that
must needs be met is severe.  The promise of eventual victory, if the army of
<w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w> Crusaders persevere in their mission, is clear and unmistakable.
<lb/>
The need of the present hour, as these communities enter upon the third, and,
what promises to be, the most brilliant phase of a World Spiritual Crusade, is a
<pb n="414"/>still greater consecration to the Cause of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in all its aspects, and a renewed
dedication in all the divers fields of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activity.
<lb/>
That the members of the Australian and New Zealand communities will
unanimously rise to the present occasion, that they will not allow any consideration
whatever to deflect them from their high purpose in the days to come, that they will
expend every ounce of energy for the attainment of these shining goals, is the
deepest longing of my heart and the object of my ardent prayers

<p n="4">The Guardian would like your Assembly to take in hand actively, the
question of the cost of building the Temple, as now newly designed, including
the interior changes, etc. proposed by Mr. Brogan.  It must be borne in

changes, particularly the question of enlargement, etc.</p>

in Australia during the present Ten Year Crusade, although that is not
decided, and is dependent on the estimated cost of construction, etc.</p>

<p n="6">Under no circumstances should you let the Believers know, there is
consideration being given to possible construction now, as if it does not
work out, then the Friends will be disappointed.</p>

<p n="7">One of the Friends has made a contribution for the construction, and
the Guardian himself will make a contribution, so if the cost is not too
much, a start could be made.</p>

<p n="8">Thus, you will appreciate the Guardian's request that you proceed with
the study of the cost of construction.  In that study you will have to give
consideration to the building materials, and this should be on the basis of a
material which will give a good and lasting finish, but not be too costly.</p>

<p n="9">The Guardian will await with interest, the result of your study of costs
--and will appreciate a copy of the finalized design, with Mr. Remey's Dome.</p>

<p n="1">Your loving letter of September 21st was duly received, and its contents
presented to the Beloved Guardian.</p>

<p n="2">He has carefully reviewed the matter, and feels it would be a mistake to
have any publicity concerning our activities in the South Seas, no matter
how favourable.</p>

<p n="3">Our numbers are few, and the Faith weak in most areas.  To turn the
public eye on our activities would bring friends, as well as enemies.  However,
the enemies, who would be strongly entrenched, could make it very difficult
<pb n="422"/>for our pioneers and the new <w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.  Thus, the Guardian feels it would be
highly inadvisable for an article to be printed in the Pacific Islands Monthly
at this time.  He hopes you can explain the matter in such a way as to retain
the friendship of Mr. Maude.<note n="157" type="foot">Harry Maude, eminent Pacific Islands' historian.</note></p>

the work that you have initiated there.  It is going to be very difficult for the

a new pioneer, however worthy she may be.  He urges you to try and get your

<salute>Mr. James Heggie: [National Spiritual Assembly]
<lb/>
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your Assembly with
regard to the Temple design which has been received, and the proposed
cost.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian is greatly pleased with the design as now prepared, and
feels it is entirely satisfactory to proceed with it.  The Dome is an
improvement, and the ornamental treatment of the top of the pylons of the
main floor a marked improvement.</p>

<p n="3">The cost proposed in Mr. Brogan's letter of February 7th, is however,
quite too high, for our present finances.  The Guardian feels it must be built
for a total of 120,000 Stirling Pounds.  I take it this is somewhat more than
120,000 Australian Pounds.</p>

<p n="4">The reduced cost may necessitate your reducing the size of the Building,
but if that is done, it must be on exactly the same proportions as the design
which you have sent, and which he now fully approves.</p>

<p n="5">In Mr. Brogan's letter he mentions an external treatment of white
aggregate cement, and the internal walls in colored cement.  This may
indicate he intends to apply a veneer on the outside of the reinforced concrete
building, and a veneer also on the inside.  This is what was done with
the Temple in Wilmette, and is very expensive.</p>

<p n="6">What is important now, is for the Temple to be built.  Your Assembly
should study what the Master said about the influence of the Temple in
America.  Just exactly the same influence will be manifest in Australia,
when the Temple is built.</p>

<p n="7">Thus you will see, it is not the size, nor the beauty of the Temple which
is important; rather what is important is the Temple itself.</p>

<p n="8">If you find Mr. Brogan did have in mind veneer treatment of the inside
and outside; then you will also find a substantial saving, if you can construct
the building, so the original reinforced concrete of the building, can be
treated on the outside and given the color you wish, and on the inside by
plastering on the cement.  This is just a suggestion from my experience with
the Temple in America, of which I was a Trustee for some 19 years.</p>

<p n="9">The Guardian asks that you study the matter and then let him know,
or let me know for him, what adjustments are necessary to bring the cost
down to 120,000 Sterling Pounds.</p>

<p n="10">Also perhaps for the beginning, you are planning on too much money,
for the Gardening, paths, etc.  Mr. Brogan speaks of a drive.  Just what is
this?  The immediate approaches of the Temple should not have a drive up
to the building.</p>

loving Greetings,</p>

<closer>
<salute>Faithfully yours,</salute>

If the size can be maintained, or nearly so, by a simpler treatment inside
and out, that may be a good way to approach your cost studies.

<p n="2">He was very happy to hear that you are Czechoslovakian, and that you

rendering a great service if you could visit that country again, and with
discretion and wisdom do some teaching work.</p>

<p n="3">Unfortunately he has not time to go into such detailed questions as
you have asked.  He has so many pilgrims and so much correspondence, as
well as managing the administrative affairs of the Faith at its World Centre,
that it is impossible for him anymore to go into detailed explanations.  He
would suggest that you refer your questions to some of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in Australia
who are well-grounded in the Teachings, and discuss them with them.  As
you acquire a deeper knowledge of the Teachings, and read, yourself, and
study more, you will find that most of these are no longer questions at all for
you, but are clear.  He would suggest also you read <bibl><title>Some Answered
Questions</title></bibl>.</p>

<p n="4">One thing he can assure you however is that there is nothing in the

<p n="1">I share with the assembled delegates, gathered to elect, on this historic
occasion, the second National Spiritual Assembly of the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> of the
Antipodes, the feelings of profound satisfaction and gratitude to <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>
evoked by this epoch-making event in the evolution of His Faith in that
far-off region of the globe.  I am deeply conscious of the decisive share which
the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community, labouring during more than three decades,
for the spread of the light of this glorious Revelation among the highly
progressive people of that distant continent, has had in the laying of the
foundation of the Administrative Order and the erection of yet another
pillar of the future Universal House of Justice in this remote Dominion.</p>

<p n="2">The emergence of this independent <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community, no matter how
limited its numerical strength and modest its resources, must be regarded as
a highly significant development in the rise and establishment of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Faith in the Pacific Area, and should synchronise with the formulation, on
the part of the National Spiritual Assembly now being elected in that Island,
of a subsidiary Six-Year Plan, designed to reinforce substantially the
numerical strength of the Community; to multiply its Centres, as well as its
Local Spiritual Assemblies; to incorporate the solidly grounded amongst
them; to inaugurate a National Fund; to obtain recognition for both the
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> marriage certificate and the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Holy Days; to lend an
unprecedented impetus to the conversion of the Maoris, and to ensure their
active participation in the conduct of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> administrative institutions; to
extend the scope of the work already initiated in the South Island; to
incorporate the newly formed National Spiritual Assembly; and to select
and acquire the site for the first <w type="dw">Mashriqu'l-Adhkar</w> of that Dominion.</p>

<p n="3">I call upon the members of the Australian National Spiritual Assembly,
as well as the members of the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community, to continue to
<pb n="431"/>lend their valued support to this newly fledged sister Community, and to
enable it, through the extension of material assistance, as well as the dispatch
of visiting teachers and pioneers, to contribute, in an ever-increasing measure,
to the furtherance of the magnificent and colossal campaign now being so
vigorously conducted in the North, in the South, and in the heart of the
Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p n="4">May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to energise this small
yet resolute, forward marching, dedicated Community, and may the outcome
of the collective efforts of its members contribute decisively to the triumphant
consummation of the World Crusade on which the entire body of the

presented to the Beloved Guardian.  He has directed me to acknowledge it
on his behalf.  Your contribution to the International Fund is greatly
appreciated.  Receipt is enclosed.</p>

<p n="2">The Guardian greatly values your devoted services to the Cause of
God.  You have arisen with consecration and dedication to spread the Glad
Tidings and establish the Faith in that far off land.  He prays for you, and for
the success of your work.  He is sure the blessings of the Master will be with
you, and you will be both guided and confirmed by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p n="3">He hopes you will be able to remain, so as to reap the harvest of your
efforts, and that the light of guidance will be given to many.  The goal is a
Spiritual Assembly, and if that could be achieved it would be a distinct and
historic victory for the Faith.</p>

Dear .....,</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your letter of April 23rd has been received by the beloved Guardian,
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p n="2">The question of your marriage is one which is clearly understood by
the National Assembly, and the Guardian thought by most of the believers;
and he is surprised that you should have been advised by <w type="dw">fellow-Baha'is</w> that
you could have a Christian marriage, in view of the fact that you are both
<w type="dw">Baha'is</w>.</p>

<p n="3">It is only fair to tell you that, if as registered believers you are married
in a Christian ceremony, you will lose your voting rights.</p>

<p n="4">You did quite right to obtain the permission of your parents; and he
hopes that now you will be able to extricate yourselves from this difficult
position you find yourselves in, without angering Mr. .... .<note n="159" type="foot">Referring to the father of the bride.</note></p>

<p n="5">As you are aware, the Guardian feels that the <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> must, in view of
the condition of the world today, stand forth firmly and courageously as
followers of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, obeying His Laws, and seeking to build his World
Order.  Through compromise we will never be able to establish our Faith or
win others' hearts to it.  This involves often great personal sacrifice, but we
know that, when we do the right thing, God gives us the strength to carry it
out, and we attract His blessings.  We learn at such times that our calamity is
indeed a blessing.</p>

<p n="6">He will pray for the satisfactory solution of your problem.</p>

<p n="1">Your letter of May 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and

<p n="2">Regarding the advice you asked him for, he feels that to devote all

need <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> authors badly, but you have to be assured that you have the
talent to earn your living in that field, and also serve the Faith in it.</p>

<p n="3">He feels that the best thing for you to do is to devote your studies to
acquiring a sound education, if you like along literary lines, and then see
what develops.</p>

<p n="4">In the meantime, the greatest possible service you could render is to
help establish a new Spiritual Assembly.  If there isn't one where you are,
then you have your job cut out for you, so to speak.</p>

<p n="5">He will pray that you may be successful, and urges you to bear in mind
that the most important thing of all at present is teaching the Faith.  We
should go on deepening our own knowledge and understanding of it, but

a <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> in New Zealand.  She lived in Melbourne in the late 1940s before

Assembly.  For several years from 1970 she pioneered in American Samoa.  Mrs
Carden contributed significantly to the planning of the Auckland International

<lb/>
Dear <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to write you on his behalf and
to assure you he was most happy to receive your letter dated May 4.</p>

<p n="2">He rejoices with the New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'is</w> in the formation of their
historic National Assembly.  They are now firmly launched on the course of
their own destiny, and undoubtedly the Faith will go forward very much
faster.  They have an advantage not shared by many of their fellow National
Assemblies, of exclusively administering the affairs of the Faith in a small
area, which means that they can function much more efficiently.  When
one remembers the many years that the New Zealand and Australian
believers toiled to carry on the work in those two countries, with the sea in
between, and inadequate funds to provide transportation, which necessitated
so much of the National Assembly's work being carried on by
correspondence, one can appreciate the advantages you now enjoy.</p>

<p n="3">The formation of a new National Body in any case is an organic thing,
and a new and lively flow of life will go out into all the members of the
Community from this Assembly.</p>

<p n="4">As regards the question you asked him about the site for the Temple,
this need not be a large piece of land at this time,--three or four acres would
be sufficient for the site if you find suitable land is expensive.  If the worst
comes to the worst, when the time comes to build the Temple, the site can
be changed.  In Uganda some years ago, they purchased a Temple site, and
later, a large piece of land for their endowment.  With the Guardian's
permission, they exchanged the two as the Endowment's position was better
for the Temple.  So you see, it need not be too rigid.  The point is to get a
Temple site as soon as possible.  He feels it should be in the outskirts of
Auckland, within easy motoring distance, so that the friends can attend
services there.  Naturally the closer to the city, the better.</p>

<p n="5">As you formulate your plans and carry them out for the work entrusted
to you during the next six years, he wishes you to particularly bear in mind
<pb n="437"/>the need of teaching the Maoris.  These original discoverers of New Zealand
are of a very fine race, and they are a people long admired for their noble
qualities; and special effort should be made, not only to contact the Maoris
in the cities, and draw them into the Faith, but to go to their towns and live
amongst them and establish Assemblies in which at least the majority of
the believers will be Maoris, if not all.  This would be indeed a worthy
achievement.</p>

<p n="6">The beloved Guardian assures you all of his prayers for the success of
the historic work you are now undertaking, and he feels sure you will achieve
your goals.</p>

[From the Guardian:]
<lb/>
<salute>Dear &amp; valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The emergence of the New Zealand National Spiritual Assembly, as a result
of the convocation of the first <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> historic Convention held in that far-away &amp;
promising Dominion, will be hailed by posterity as an event of the greatest
significance, marking the erection of another pillar designed to support in the South
Pacific area, the future Universal House of Justice.  My heart overflows with
happiness &amp; is filled with gratitude as I contemplate the splendid progress achieved,
in recent years, in that far-off island, &amp; note the loyalty &amp; devotion with which
the members of this valiant community, now standing on the threshold of
unprecedented achievements, have discharged their manifold &amp; sacred
responsibilities.
<lb/>
The six brief years that now lie ahead must witness a swift expansion in the
scope of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> activities throughout the length &amp; breadth of that Dominion, as
well as a steady consolidation of the foundations of the institutions that have been
so painstakingly laid.  The Six-Year Plan upon which the New Zealand believers
have now so auspiciously embarked must be diligently prosecuted &amp; brought to a
triumphant conclusion.  All must participate, whether young or old, veterans as
well as newly enrolled believers, all must contribute their share to the ultimate
success of this mighty collective enterprise, however limited their means, however
modest their abilities, however restricted the range of their previous experiences.
<lb/>
The increase in the number of the avowed adherents of the Faith; the
multiplication of isolated centres, groups, &amp; Local Assemblies; the incorporation
of the newly formed National Spiritual Assembly as well as all firmly grounded
Local Assemblies; the recognition of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> marriage certificate by the civil
authorities, &amp; of the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Holy Days by the superintendent of schools in that
island; the rapid conversion of the Maoris &amp; their close association with the white
believers in the administration of the affairs of the community; the consolidation
of the work energetically initiated in the South Island; the selection &amp; purchase of the
site for the Mother Temple of New Zealand-these stand out as the foremost
<pb n="438"/>objectives of the Plan now demanding of its high minded determined prosecutors,
the utmost consecration, unrelaxing vigilance &amp; the noblest self-sacrifice.
<lb/>
The tasks challenging the spirit and resources of this community, whose
numerical strength is as yet so limited, whose material resources are so
circumscribed, whose past experiences have in many respects been confined to a
narrow range, are truly formidable.  The allotted time, during which so stupendous
an undertaking is to be consummated, is short.  The obstacles confronting its
members are varied and manifold.  Yet the sustaining grace promised to all those
who will arise, with high-mindedness, courage, dedication &amp; high resolve, to aid
in the attainment of these noble objectives, is of such potency that no earthly
power can resist the ultimate fulfilment of so glorious a task, or even delay its
eventual fruition.
<lb/>
I appeal most earnestly to all those who, in both the teaching &amp; administrative
fields, are committed to carry out so magnificent an enterprise, as well as to those
who, in an unofficial capacity, are called upon to further, by every means in their
power, the interests of this epoch-making Plan, to dedicate themselves, at this
hour, to the arduous, yet infinitely precious task they have shouldered, &amp; to devote,
in the days and years that lie ahead, every ounce of their energy, to the systematic
prosecution of a Plan, on which the immediate destinies of the entire New Zealand
<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community directly depend, &amp; which can alone provide the stepping-stone
to the still more brilliant achievements destined to ennoble the annals of the Faith
in that remote island of the globe.

<w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Brother:</salute>
</opener>

<p n="1">Your Assembly's communications with their enclosures and material
sent under separate cover have all been safely received by the beloved
Guardian; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to
<pb n="439"/>acknowledge receipt of your letters dated: August 14, September 6, October
14 and 29, and December 3, 1956, and February 17 and March 24, May 9,
June 12 and 19, 1957.</p>

<p n="2">In connection with various matters raised in your letters:</p>

<p n="3">The photograph of the Shrine on Mt. Carmel was sent to Dr. Brasch,<note n="161" type="foot">Prominent Rabbi in the Australian Jewish community.</note>
and we hope that he received it safely.</p>

<p n="4">As regards the <bibl><title level="j">Herald of the South</title></bibl> magazine, in view of the important
work lying ahead of your Assembly, and the fact that this magazine is a
drain on the limited resources of the Community, he thinks it would be
quite all right to suspend publication until a future date when the financial
situation permits such expenditures to be made with relative ease.  He leaves,
however, the final decision to your Assembly.</p>

<p n="5">The Committee responsible for the publication of this magazine has
certainly laboured valiantly throughout the years, and the publication will
be missed by its readers.  However, it is some years since the American <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
Magazine was abandoned for similar reasons, and the Guardian feels that
you can do so in Australia, and the funds be used to better advantage, at this
time.  However, now that you have found a printer in Sydney and appointed
a new committee, he thinks you should continue it and give the new Plan a
try.</p>

<p n="6">The progress your Assembly has been making on the plans for the
Temple, in conjunction with the evidently very able and cooperative
architect whom you have found in Sydney, greatly pleases and encourages
the beloved Guardian.  He is particularly happy to know that Mr. Brogan is
pliable in his ideas, and enthusiastic about getting the Temple constructed,
even though the original design is not his own.  Unfortunately, owing to
the age of Mr. Remey and his duties at the International Centre, it is
impossible for him to carry out, himself, the execution in detail of his plans
or to supervise the construction; and consequently both the Kampala Temple
and the Sydney Temple have been entrusted to reliable firms.</p>

<p n="7">The influence that this Mother Temple of the whole Pacific area will
exert when constructed, is incalculable and mysterious.  The beloved Master
told the American friends that their Temple would be the greatest silent
teacher, and there is no doubt that this one building has exerted a profound
influence on the spread of the Faith, not only in the United States and the
Western Hemisphere, but throughout the world.  We can therefore expect
that the construction of another "Mother Temple" in the heart of Australasia,
and one in the center of Africa, as well as one in the heart of Europe, will
exert a tremendous influence, both locally and internationally.</p>

<p n="8">He is eagerly waiting to receive pictures of the inauguration of the
<pb n="440"/>work on the Temple site, and has recently mailed your Assembly under
separate cover a piece of the plaster from the Room in the Fortress at <w type="dw">Mah-Ku</w>
where the <w type="dw">Bab</w> was confined, as well as a letter requesting that dear
Mother Dunn place this, as his representative, in the foundations of the
Temple.  He would like very much to have a good photograph of this
ceremony for reproduction; and he also urges your Assembly to give as much
publicity to this occasion, and to the Temple work in general, as possible.</p>

<p n="9">The teaching work carried on by the Australian friends throughout
the region of the Pacific under their jurisdiction, has been very satisfactory,
and he is proud of the truly immense progress which has been made.  The
publication of literature in so many additional languages, the School opened
by Mrs. Dobbins in the New Hebrides, the increase in the number of native
believers throughout the islands, are all indications, not only of the great
power of this Faith to touch the hearts of those who are spiritually receptive,
but also of the consecration and devotion of the Australian believers.</p>

<p n="10">As regards various questions you asked in your letter of February 17th:</p>

<p n="11">It is of the utmost importance to keep the pioneers in their goals.  If,
for reasons over which you have no control, they are forced to leave a certain
pioneer area, then he would strongly recommend that, instead of returning
all the way to their home base, they be routed to another base in the Pacific
where they can serve the Faith.  This is both economical, and hastens the
attainment of our goals.  Matters of detail as to how these plans are best
worked out, are naturally left to the discretion of the National Body
responsible for the area in question.</p>

<p n="12">In your letter of August 14th, you mention a small translation of a
Timorese language has been secured from Dili.  The Guardian would like to
know what the specific name of this language is, and, if it has been printed,
he would like to receive a copy.</p>

<p n="13">He was very sorry to hear that dear Mother Dunn's son had died.<note n="162" type="foot">Allan Davis.</note>
This, no doubt, in spite of her devotion and fortitude, must have been a
severe blow to her at her age; and he hopes the friends will do all they can
to comfort and take care of this precious soul--the mother of their
Community.  Please assure her that he prays for the progress of the soul of
her son in the Holy Shrines.</p>

<p n="14">The successful culmination of the long standing partnership of the
Australian and New Zealand believers thru the emergence of the New
Zealand N.S.A. is a source of great satisfaction to the Guardian, and no
doubt to all the members of both communities.  He feels sure this will mark
a turning point in the work in the Antipodes and the neighbouring islands
and give a new lease of life to the teaching work throughout that area.  Both
<pb n="441"/>your Assembly and that of New Zealand have now emerged into your
permanent form as pillars of the future International House of Justice.  The
bones of the skeleton of the World Order are growing strong, but only the
teaching work can clothe them with flesh.</p>

<p n="15">You may be sure that he will ardently pray for the success of your work,
and that you may be strengthened and guided to discharge your important
duties and to fulfil your goals under the Ten Year Plan.</p>

<lb/>
<salute>Dear and valued co-workers:</salute>
<lb/>
The progress achieved in recent years, rapid and extraordinary as it has been,
by the <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Communities labouring so patiently, so methodically, and so faithfully,
for the consolidation and expansion of the institutions of the embryonic World
Order of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> in the Antipodes, has been highly gratifying and has served
to deepen my confidence in their ability to achieve their high destiny, and to evoke
sentiments of ever-increasing admiration for the manner in which they have acquitted
themselves of their task in the face of varied and almost insurmountable obstacles.
<lb/>
Particularly commendable, and indeed exemplary, has been the share of the
Australian believers in enabling the New Zealand <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> Community to make
such rapid strides, in recent years, strides that have prepared it for the assumption
of its sacred and vital function as an independent community, and which culminated
in the formation of a body qualified to take its place, and assume the weighty
responsibilities incumbent on it, as a distinct and separate member of the world-wide
family of <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies.  The great and
signal honour, conferred upon their homeland through the selection of one of the
most highly advanced, the most populous, and one of the most progressive of its
cities--enjoying already the distinction of being the first among them to be opened
to the Message of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w> and to be warmed by the rising Sun of His Revelation
--as the site of the Mother Temple of the Antipodes, and indeed of the whole
Pacific area, moreover, proclaims their right to be considered the vanguard of His
hosts, and the defenders of the stronghold of the Administrative Order of His
Faith, in that vast area of the globe, an area endowed with unimaginable
potentialities, and which, owing to its strategic position, is bound to feel the impact
of world shaking forces, and to shape to a marked degree through the experience
gained by its peoples in the school of adversity, the destinies of mankind.
<lb/>
The emergence of a new Regional Spiritual Assembly in the North Pacific
Area, with its seat fixed in the capital city of a country which by reason of its
innate capacity and the spiritual receptivity it has acquired, in consequence of the
severe and prolonged ordeal its entire population has providentially experienced, is
destined to have a preponderating share in awakening the peoples and races
inhabiting the entire Pacific area, to the Message of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>, and to act as the
<pb n="442"/>Vanguard of His hosts in their future spiritual conquest of the main body of the
yellow race on the Chinese mainland-the emergence of such an Assembly may be
said to have, at long last, established a spiritual axis, extending from the Antipodes
to the northern islands of the Pacific Ocean--an axis whose northern and southern
poles will act as powerful magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual potency,
and towards which other younger and less experienced communities will tend for
some time to gravitate.
<lb/>
A responsibility, at once weighty and inescapable, must rest on the communities
which occupy so privileged a position in so vast and turbulent an area of the globe.
However great the distance that separates them; however much they differ in race,
language, custom, and religion; however active the political forces which tend to
keep them apart and foster racial and political antagonisms, the close and continued
association of these communities in their common, their peculiar and paramount
task of raising up and of consolidating the embryonic World Order of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah</w>
in those regions of the globe, is a matter of vital and urgent importance, which
should receive on the part of the elected representatives of their communities, a
most earnest and prayerful consideration.
<lb/>
The Plan, which it is the privilege of the Australian <w type="dw">Baha'i</w> community to
energetically prosecute must, simultaneously, be assured of the unqualified, the
systematic and whole-hearted support of its members.
<lb/>
Theirs indeed is a twofold task which must under no circumstances be either
neglected or underrated.  The one aims at the consolidation, the multiplication
and expansion of the institutions so laboriously erected throughout the length and
breadth of the Australian commonwealth and in the islands beyond its confines, in
strict accordance with the provisions of the Ten-Year Plan, while the other is designed
to forge fresh links with its sister communities, and particularly those situated in
the North, in anticipation of the Mission which the newly fledged <w type="dw">Baha'i</w>
communities, now rapidly multiplying throughout the length and breadth of that
area, are destined and are collectively called upon to discharge.
<lb/>
Whilst addressing itself to the meritorious twofold task with which it is now
confronted, this wide-awake, swiftly expanding, steadily consolidating, highly
promising community must lend whatever assistance is possible to its newly emerged
sister community in the South, and enable her, as her institutions develop and
become firmly grounded, to share in a befitting manner, in the collective enterprises
that must, sooner or later, be launched and carried to a successful conclusion by
the island communities situated in the Northern and Southern regions as well as in
the heart of the Pacific Ocean.
<lb/>
May this community which, with its sister community in the North, has had
the inestimable privilege of being called into being in the lifetime of, and through
the operation of the dynamic forces released by the Centre of <w type="dw">Baha'u'llah's</w>
Covenant, continue, with undimmed vision, with redoubled vigour, and
unwavering fidelity and constancy, to discharge its manifold and ever increasing
<pb n="443"/>duties and responsibilities, and lend, as the days go by, an impetus such as it has
not lent before, in the course of almost two score years of its existence, to the
propagation of the Faith it has so whole-heartedly espoused and is now so valiantly
serving, and play a memorable and distinctive part in hastening the establishment,
and in ensuring the gradual efflorescence and ultimate fruition, of its divinely
appointed embryonic World Order.

mean permanent opposition to his return.  If you had occasion at a future
