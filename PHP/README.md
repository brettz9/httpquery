Place static files within this "PHP" directory. If you are doing more than serving static HTML/XML/XHTML/TEI files from this
directory, please confirm that the ".htaccess" file meets your URL-rewriting needs.

statement which is part of the HTTPQuery class expects the root "phpquery" folder as a sibling to the root folder
containing this repository.
